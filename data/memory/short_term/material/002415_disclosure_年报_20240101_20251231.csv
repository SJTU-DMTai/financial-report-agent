Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
1 
To Shareholders 
In response to the complicated and dynamic business climate in 2024, the Company tapped into 
the potential of the Chinese security market and more actively expanded its security business overseas, 
while remaining committed to scenario-based digitization and innovative businesses. In 2024, the 
combined revenue of our overseas main businesses and innovative businesses surpassed the revenue 
of our domestic main businesses, that is, the total revenue of three businesses groups - PBG, EBG 
and SMBG - for the first time in our history. 
The Company is determined to bolster its investment in R&D. Seeing the rise of large AI models, 
we actively expand the development of AIoT-powered large multimodal model technology. It is our 
business tenet to identify target markets, align with the advancement of cutting-edge technology, and 
incorporate new technologies into software and hardware products. The Company will keep growing 
its product lines and increasing application scenarios based on its persistent efforts to develop sensing 
technologies utilizing full electromagnetic waves, mechanical waves, and multi-band fusion. Since 
2018, the Company has maintained a steady increase in R&D investment, actively responding to the 
continuously deteriorating global operating environment through technological innovation. 
The Company will readily adapt itself to the times. In the years to come, we will shift our focus 
from faster expansion to higher efficiency, ensuring strong performance for all existing businesses. 
Moreover, the Company plans to modify its operating mechanism and optimize its organizational 
structure to better adapt to changes in the external business environment, while leveraging digital 
technology to increase operational efficiency both internally and externally. 
The Company's commitment to global development will not change. Amid the ongoing political 
and economic turbulence worldwide, the Company is subject to standing, severe repression in some 
foreign countries, and is expected to face new challenges in the future. However, we are resolute in 
consistently increasing our investment in overseas marketing and expanding the percentage of 
overseas revenue – thanks to the indomitable spirit we have developed over the last 20 years in 
overseas market development. 
The Company will always be customer-centric and create value for customers regardless of how

the business environment changes. Finally, we wish to express our gratitude to all shareholders for 
their trust in and support for the Company! 
 
See far, go further!

Please read the full annual report and pay particular attention to the following risk factors:  
1) 
Domestic Economic Transformation Risks: The domestic market is undergoing continuous adjustments in 
fiscal spending and real estate investment, leading to a need for improvement in societal expectations for 
economic development. Additionally, some overseas nations are implementing trade protectionist policies, 
which pose challenges to the export capabilities of domestic enterprises. The economy remains in a transitional 
phase of upgrading and transformation. The Company empowers economic and social digital transformation 
with AIoT technologies and products, driving new developments in productivity. However, the process of 
transformation and upgrading cannot be achieved overnight, and long-term structural pressures on the economy 
and society persist. Fluctuations during this process will continue to impact the company's operations. 
2) 
Global Economic Downturn Risks: Growth in key economies has decelerated, regional development remains 
unbalanced worldwide, and macroeconomic volatility persists. The Company mitigates operational risks in 
specific regions through its diversified business footprint, tailoring strategies to local conditions. However, 
should a global economic recession occur, the company's operations may still face material impacts. 
3) 
Geopolitical Environment Risks: The global political system is evolving toward multipolarity, with stability 
and predictability continuously diminishing, while conflictsin certain regions persist unresolved. In recent 
years, the Company has strengthened risk management and enhanced response capabilities, adjusting resource 
allocations in line with operational environments. Nevertheless, should geopolitical conditions deteriorate 
abruptly, the Company's operations in certain countries and regions may still face adverse impacts. 
4) 
Technological Obsolescence Risks: Technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of 
Things (IoT), and cloud computing are advancing rapidly, with iterative updates accelerating. The Company 
has established a certain level of expertise in areas such as IoT sensing, AI, and big data, and has maintained 
technological advancement through extensive commercial practices. However, if the Company fails to closely 
monitor the evolution of cutting-edge technologies or maintain innovation and expansion within its 
technological framework, the uncertainty risks associated with future development will intensify. 
5) 
Internal Management Risks: The Company's expanding operational scale, continuous diversification of 
products and services, and increasing internal complexity are elevating new challenges to governance 
capabilities. Through institutionalization and process standardization, the Company codifies management 
expertise while emphasizing talent pipeline development. However, should management capabilities fail to 
keep pace with business growth, operational performance could be compromised.
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report

6) 
Financial Risks Caused by Customers' Reduced Ability to Pay: The liquidity of commercial transactions 
is susceptible to economic volatility, with the Company's capital turnover being closely tied to the operational 
conditions of partners across the value chain. While maintaining robust collection mechanisms, prudent 
operations, and substantial cash reserves with low financing costs, the Company may still face slower payment 
recovery and operational disruptions should overall market liquidity risks escalate. 
7) 
Legal and Compliance Risks: Multilateral trade mechanisms are significantly impacted by political events, 
and the laws and regulations that commercial activities must comply with are complex and vary from country 
to country. There is a trend towards stricter data regulations globally, which poses higher demands on the 
Company's legal and compliance capabilities. The Company has established an effective legal and compliance 
management system through practical experience and has undergone multiple business tests domestically and 
internationally. However, if the Company's legal and compliance capabilities cannot keep up with the evolving 
situation, it may still have a negative impact on operations. 
8) 
Supply Chain Risks: Some countries are using supply chains as a means of international competition, and the 
global supply system has been continuously impacted by geopolitical events in recent years. Despite efforts to 
establish diversified supply networks and properly manage inventory, the Company may still be affected by a 
widespread supply chain disruption, which could impact its business stability. 
9) 
Cybersecurity Risks: The Company consistently emphasizes cybersecurity capabilities and system 
development, actively implementing measures to enhance product and system security. However, incidents 
such as computer viruses, malware, and hacker attacks may still occur, potentially damaging the Company's 
systems or products and creating cybersecurity vulnerabilities. 
10) Exchange Rate Volatility Risks: The Company conducts operations in multiple countries and regions 
overseas, primarily settling transactions in foreign currencies. While employing reasonable financial 
instruments for risk hedging, inherent foreign currency exposure from sales, procurement, and financing 
activities remains. Exchange rate fluctuations may consequently affect the Company's financial performance. 
11) Intellectual Property Risks: The Company maintains substantial R&D investments yielding numerous 
technological achievements, supported by relatively comprehensive intellectual property protection measures. 
Nevertheless, risks of intellectual property disputes and infringement persist. 
The above-mentioned alerts do not include all the potential risks for the Company. Investors are advised to invest 
with caution.

defects of a product, from the monitoring data of public utilities to natural environment... These products help
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
18 
address specific problems on the site in each real-world scenario and fuel the digital transformation of thousands of 
industries. 
2.1.1 Visible light perception 
Hikvision's vast expertise in visible light imaging serves as the foundation for its ongoing product innovation. 
Through hardware structure design and algorithm capability optimization, it develops digital solutions for scenarios 
beyond security, represented by manufacturing, environmental monitoring, and equipment management. 
In the element collection stage, Hikvision integrates visible light imaging with data from sensors such as 
visibility meters, GNSS (global navigation satellite systems), accelerometers, and gyroscopes to develop multi-
dimensional perception capabilities; in the intelligent analysis stage, capabilities such as high sensitivity, high 
accuracy, and convenient configuration are enabled leveraging breakthroughs in the application of large vision 
models; and in the stage of scenario application, through new materials and processes like self-cleaning technology, 
remote automatic adjustment technology, and vibration-absorbing materials, Hikvision has ensured the adaptability 
of products to special environments and created truly easy-to-operate and maintenance-free smart cameras. 
Visibility meters: On expressways and highways, reduced visibility increases the risk of traffic accidents. 
Individual visibility sensors are susceptible to rain, snow, dust, water mist and other environmental factors, and 
when anomalous data is produced, maintenance costs might be considerable. In order to precisely detect changes in 
mist and eliminate false alarms, Hikvision uses visibility detecting sensors that meet national standards in 
conjunction with sensors for temperature, humidity, air pressure, and rainfall. Moreover, spider-web-free, auto
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
19 
rotating and wiper features are included to enable self-cleaning and eliminate the need for maintenance, 
guaranteeing long-term, stable operation. 
Cameras for robotic arm collision avoidance: As industrial robotic arms generate huge energy when running, 
unauthorized access to the operating area may cause safety accidents. In three-dimensional space, traditional 
protective measures like fences and gratings are ineffective in providing complete protection. Hikvision's camera 
for robotic arm collision avoidance is powered by binocular stereo vision imaging technology and embedded with 
a large model algorithm for people categorization and identification. The camera can accurately identify individuals 
with the use of billions of data sets for preliminary training and algorithm optimization based on the safe operating 
scenarios of robotic arms. When an individual enters and remains in a robotic arm's operating area, the camera will 
respond quickly with a prompt alarm to avoid human-machine collision caused by improper operation of the robotic 
arm, guaranteeing scenario-specific safety with high accuracy and high reliability.

21 
 
High-precision measurement cameras for visual structures: Based on optical imaging principles and visual 
imaging technology, the Company has introduced a series of high-precision measurement cameras for visual 
structures. The camera is designed to image the target and calculate the target's pixel change. Combined with a pre-
calibrated matrix algorithm, it converts pixel displacement into physical space displacement to enable contactless 
measurement. The solution outperforms traditional measurement approaches with visible outcomes, easy 
installation and easy maintenance. In particular, the vision‐based displacement measurement camera applies a sub-
pixel vision‐based displacement detection algorithm to monitor the target pixel changes on the target object and 
calculate the horizontal and vertical displacement change values of the measured target at the target position. As an 
alternative to hydrostatic level measurement, it offers high-frequency detection of 50 times per second and 
measurement with 0.1mm precision. The image-based crack meter, with a built-in image-based intelligent crack 
detection and measurement algorithm, performs image preprocessing on the identified concrete cracks, and 
precisely measures crack width through edge finding, outlining, positioning, segmentation, point-by-point 
measurement and other processes. Then crack encoding and a dynamic error calibration algorithm are used to track 
crack changes in sub-millimeters point-by-point. This series of high-precision measurement cameras for visual 
structures have wide uses such as bridge structural health monitoring, building settlement, and creeps of rail, 
providing intelligent solutions for the digital construction of infrastructure such as transportation facilities and 
structures.

recognition solutions to logistics and express, retail e-commerce, healthcare, manufacturing, public services and
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
23 
other industries. 
 
Ultra-depth-of-field 3D digital microscopes: The solution, which features AI-based image augmentation and 
high-resolution imaging, allows blur-to-clear conversion with a single click. Without requiring a manual lens change, 
it has all-electric magnification switches that can be adjusted from 30 to 6000 times using the mouse and handle. 
The microscope's innovative ultra-depth-of-field synthesis and multi-mode 3D stitching technology enable it to 
precisely restore the three-dimensional morphology of samples. This makes it a perfect tool for detecting 
microscopic defects in industries like semiconductors, lithium batteries, and automobiles, as well as an intelligent 
upgrading method for scientific research, industrial quality inspection, and other fields.

production, circulation and quality control. HikRobot, which specializes in industrial production process traceability 
and logistics sorting, has developed a full range of industrial barcode scanners, including fixtures, handheld guns 
and barcode scanning modules. This series is equipped with a high-performance hardware platform, and adopts a 
deep learning-based decoding solution and multicolor light imaging optimization technology. This leads to a high 
and stable recognition rate as well as exceptional decoding performance and efficiency in response to less readable 
barcodes caused by broken needles, ink overflow and other issues. These products are compact, highly protective,
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
24 
and adaptable to a variety of challenging conditions. Most of them fulfill primary industrial protocols and 
communication requirements.  
AI-based industrial cameras: Smart industrial camera is a kind of machine vision product that combines 
image acquisition, light source, image processing, and communication equipment. It is extensively used in many 
industrial scenarios. HikRobot has developed a full lineup of smart cameras with built-in, exclusive, high-
performance machine vision processing algorithms. Upon easy setup, the camera can perform visual inspection 
without the need for programming thanks to its modular design and user-friendly interface. It is highly integrated, 
compact, and easy to maintain, making it ideal for installation in confined locations. In addition to detection for 
presence, front/back, position, size, and defects, the product is also embedded with AI registration and learning, AI 
character recognition/code reading and other edge learning and deep learning detection algorithms, offering superior 
functions and high cost performance in quality inspection for conventional equipment production and other 
applications.

2.1.2 Millimeter wave perception 
Millimeter wave radars, which accurately measure a target's distance, speed, angle and other attributes, have 
become an indispensable technical means in many fields. Hikvision is dedicated to multiple technical routes such 
as millimeter wave radars and radar-video fusion. Driven by dual wheels - technological innovation and scenario-
based demands, the Company has introduced radar products beyond the realm of security. These offerings are widely 
and creatively applied in transportation, industrial manufacturing and other domains, bolstering the intelligent 
upgrade of all sectors. 
Millimeter-wave radars are widely used in the industrial field. In 2024, Hikvision applied its 1D–4D product 
matrix in over 100 scenarios across industries like cement, building materials, chemicals, steel, metallurgy, 
electricity, mining, food, breeding, pharmaceuticals, ports and other industries. These include high-temperature 
clinker warehouses, highly corrosive sulfuric acid tanks, highly dusty lime silos, explosion-proof coal silos, low-
dielectric-constant PTA storage tanks, strong-clutter alumina silos, and low-temperature strong-water-vapor slag 
grab cranes, among other harsh settings. Hikvision's solution improves productivity and lowers operating costs by 
addressing issues such as low accuracy of material measurement, unstable detection, inefficient spatial scanning, 
and high failure rate, creating substantial value for a variety of sectors. 
Positioning radars: Precise positioning devices are necessary for the unattended operation of heavy equipment, 
including overhead cranes, hoists, and port machinery, in industries such as coal mining, steel metallurgy, and ports. 
Large machinery become intelligent thanks to Hikvision's radars, which can pinpoint their location with centimeter-
level precision. This enables accurate route planning and efficient operations. The positioning radar, based on the 
principle of secondary radar and a distributed control form, facilitates incoherent, full-duplex ""communication + 
perception."" With direct wave, measurements may be made more precisely and steadily over a greater distance. So
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
26 
far, the solution has been used in real-world scenarios such as slag grab cranes and material shed stacker-reclaimers. 
Fast imaging radars: Dynamic real-time material level monitoring is essential for industrial silos with high-
speed, mass material flow. Overstock or understock may result from delayed feedback of material height or volume, 
which directly compromises safety and reduces the industrial chain's collaborative efficiency. To address this, 
Hikvision has iterated minute-level imaging radars and pioneered in applying optical communication technology to 
millimeter-wave scanning imaging, eliminating the need for physical slip ring structures in two-dimensional 
scanning. Coupled with the calibration process that unifies two-dimensional and three-dimensional coordinates, the 
scanning time is greatly reduced from minutes to within 10 seconds. Thus, the usage of imaging radars has expanded 
from basic back-end monitoring services to front-end industrial control, enabling users to manage material pile 
warehouses, equipment, and statistical reports in a more accurate and intuitive manner. These radars are now used 
in a variety of sectors, including cement, building materials, food, breeding, metallurgy, electricity, and ports. 
Radar level meters: An 80GHz high-frequency radar that has a 120m range, a 3° beam angle, and ±2mm 
precision can be used for continuous, non-contact and accurate level measurement of solid materials and liquids in 
industrial silos, piles, tanks, pools, and more. An AI-based false echo suppression algorithm integrated into the 
device automatically scans and marks sources of interference such as stirring parts and beams in a tank, intelligently 
suppresses and shields them, and outputs the exact level value on site. The Company operates a laboratory dedicated 
to testing radar level meters in a range of hard working situations, guaranteeing that its products maintain accurate 
measurement under challenging settings including high temperature, high pressure, corrosion, dust, foam, and 
adhesion. Hikvision's radar level meters have been widely used in chemical, power generation, steel, cement, food 
and other industries. 
Radar-video integrated devices for intelligent transportation: Hikvision's radar-video integrated device for 
intelligent transportation extracts and fuses radar and video features prior to target detection. In other words, it 
directly extracts multi-frame video images and real-time radar point cloud features for feature-level pre-fusion, and 
then obtains the target's speed, distance, direction, unique identification code and other information. The ""feature-
level pre-fusion"" eliminates the constraints of individual sensors, allowing for the simultaneous collection, labeling, 
and fusion of multi-dimensional data. This is accompanied by a higher matching rate of radar-video fusion and a 
more continuous target detection trajectory, endowing the product with ultra-long-distance, high-precision vehicle 
and traffic trajectory detection capabilities. Compared with vision or radar sensors, Hikvision's radar-video assisted 
products exhibit consistent performance in both daytime and night, as well as in rainy and foggy environments, and
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
27 
have been extensively used.  
Radar-video assisted FOD (foreign object debris) detectors: High-resolution radar detection combined with 
video review leads to a higher accuracy of foreign object detection. The device can detect foreign objects on airport 
runways such as mechanical parts, stones, plastics, birds, and metal devices, with centimeter-level precision 
(20mm*20mm). The combination of radar detection and video review allows for 24/7 detection of foreign object 
debris on runways - even in bad weather such as rain, snow and fog, with an accuracy of more than 95%. 
2.1.3 Infrared perception 
Infrared perception technology, which is based on the infrared radiation characteristics of objects, enables 
precise monitoring and intelligent analysis through non-contact temperature imaging. Combining infrared thermal 
imaging technology with MEMS technology, the Company has been engaged in the iteration and upgrading of 
technology and products to meet the demands of industrial production, industrial firefighting, scientific research 
and other fields. The aim is to help improve productivity and safety, and provide standardized temperature sensors 
for industrial quality control and multidisciplinary basic research. 
PTZ cameras for high-precision positioning: PTZ cameras for high-precision positioning, powered by dual 
closed-loop optical image stabilization technology (collaborative control by motor + encoder), plus space perception 
and attitude perception modules, can locate a fire point within a distance of 3km, with an accuracy of ≤50m (based 
on test data in Tai'an project). This provides a solid foundation for precise positioning and rescue decisions in the 
early stages of the fire. The full-scenario, self-cleaning system features innovative semiconductor-based 
condensation water spraying technology that enables air-to-water and remote control of wiper cleaning. This 
effectively mitigates imaging blur caused by lens contaminants, ensuring consistent image clarity in diverse 
environmental conditions. The product is equipped with a one-button calibration system to reduce the manual 
calibration of fire points, greatly shorten the equipment debugging cycle, and lower installation and debugging costs. 
In outdoor fire prevention scenarios such as forest fire prevention, it provides sound technical support for holistic 
risk management.

Linglong shortwave thermometers: In high-temperature processes such as steel rolling and single-crystal 
silicon growth furnaces, traditional temperature measuring equipment has shortcomings such as bulky size and 
narrow field of view, resulting in inflexible deployment and large blind spots. The Linglong shortwave thermometer 
series developed by HikMicro has a weight reduction of more than 30% and a larger field of view. With two-color 
infrared technology, it measures temperature over a wide range of 300~3200℃. Also, the AI-ISP is applied to 
address overexposure and color cast in high/low temperature settings and restore the true color and details of molten 
pools and crystal growth furnace thermal fields, thus assisting with accurate judgment during manufacturing 
processes. 
Anti-fouling and high-temperature-resistant thermal detector-imagers: In view of mold release agent 
spray failure caused by oil mist pollution and uneven temperature field on the mold surface in the die-casting process, 
the anti-fouling and high-temperature-resistant thermal detector-imagers use non-contact, real-time temperature 
field imaging to rapidly locate cold and hot defects on molds, ensuring precise temperature control and improved
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
29 
productivity. The mechanical protection cover (which opens only at the time of temperature measuring) and high-
pressure airtight anti-fouling technology are intended to prevent oil mist intrusion; coupled with the detachable 
germanium sheet protection layer and air cooling system, the device is suitable for long-term operation in a high-
temperature environment of 150°C with a long service life. It is expected to increase the yield rate and standardize 
processes in scenarios like die-casting the structural components of new energy vehicles (NEVs). 
Microscopic thermal detector-imagers: HikMicro's microscopic thermal detector-imagers are designed to 
monitor the temperature field of micron-level targets (such as solder joints of electronic components and melting 
points of optical fibers). With one-button switch between regular/macro modes, the device supports a minimum 
detection distance of 35μm (about 1/3 the diameter of a hair), and can quickly change the observation scale without 
removing the lens; ±1°C or ±1% high-precision temperature measurement (with a range of -20~150°C) and 8-hour 
continuous, adaptive, block-free environmental data acquisition reduce the possibility of missing data frames. 
Integrated with real-time/offline analysis and one-click generation of standardized reports, the device can serve as 
a standardized temperature perception tool for multidisciplinary basic research and industrial quality control in 
fields such as electronic information, materials, biomedicine, chemistry, and electricity. 
 
Flame detectors for industrial fire protection: Industrial fire protection has higher requirements for detection 
accuracy, response time, protection, stability and other metrics. With ongoing efforts to develop more flame 
detection methods and improve detection accuracy, HikFire has launched flame detectors for the purpose of 
industrial fire prevention. Using multi-dimensional perception + video, the solution can accurately detect the 
temperature, smoke, flame and other features of different objects when they burn, and eliminate false alarms caused 
by typical industrial production conditions such as high temperature. In particular, infrared imaging-based fire 
detectors enable intelligent fire identification with higher accuracy (0.1m2 fire panel, within a distance of up to
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
30 
150m), and the false alarm rate is reduced by more than 30%. Three-band infrared flame detectors can accurately 
detect the combustion of organic matter against environmental interference such as sunlight. Therefore, they may 
be further applied to semi-outdoor and outdoor settings such as industrial storage tank areas and rail platforms. 
Infrared-ultraviolet fusion flame detectors, which can perceive the 4-micron band of the combustion of special 
materials such as metals, are suitable for sheet metal processing, electric welding, hot work and other uses. 
Industrial shortwave infrared cameras: HikRobot's industrial shortwave infrared camera is a high-
performance industrial infrared camera equipped with an InGaAs sensor. Thanks to its wide coverage from 400nm-
1700nm visible light to shortwave bands, one camera can meet the need for both visible light and shortwave infrared 
detection, coupled with lower system costs, higher processing speed, and a broader detection range. The camera is 
equipped with multiple image pre-processing functions and also a TEC (thermo electric cooler) to maintain its 
temperature below room temperature 25℃, thus reducing the noise of prolonged operation and long exposure and 
ensuring image quality. Moreover, with a number of trigger modes and incident outputs supported, the solution 
flexibly adapts to different industrial settings spanning new energy, semiconductors, laser spots, agriculture, food 
and medicine, material sorting, printing and other industries. 
2.1.4 X-ray perception 
An X-ray is a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation with an extremely short wavelength and it is 
highly penetrating. Given the different absorption of X-rays by materials, the radiation can clearly distinguish 
minute size variations and subtle structural changes for the purpose of high-precision detection. Leveraging its 
extensive expertise in radioscopic testing in industrial production, the Company has developed high-precision 
radioscopic detection capabilities ranging from macro (millimeter level) to micro (micron level), from 2D imaging 
to 3D imaging, and launched products around its two key businesses - component counting and defect detection, in 
an effort to help customers improve detection quality, enhance detection efficiency, and strengthen management.
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
31 
 
X-ray component counters: In an efficiently operating SMT (surface mount technology) workshop, accurate 
component counting is essential to the efficiency and accuracy of electronics assembly. Due to the wide variety and 
large quantity of components, traditional manual counting is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive, but also 
prone to errors and omissions. HikRayin's X-ray intelligent counter can finish counting four trays of components in 
8 seconds, with an accuracy of up to 99.99%. The counting outcomes may be connected to MES to enable multi-
dimensional control over factory production data, contributing to the intelligent transformation of warehousing. 
  
X-ray defect detectors: Taking the quality inspection of integrated circuits in NEVs as an example, 
conventional 2D detection cannot identify defects in the circuit board welding process (such as Head-in-Pillow in
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
32 
BGA and immersion tin in PTH) due to imaging interference; and due to the high output, large batches, and stringent 
inspection requirements, traditional sampling often takes a long time. HikRayin's online 3D CT inspection device 
employs three-dimensional imaging technology to perform 360-degree radioscopic imaging and cross-sectional 
analysis both globally and locally. This allows for the intuitive discovery of defects and their locations. When 
combined with a fast detection algorithm, the solution is able to detect defects in an efficient and automatic manner. 
 
When it comes to the production of vehicle sensors, it is important to detect defects in internal sensing 
components, but due to plastic housings, it is impossible to identify them with the naked eye. However, the 
combination of X-ray high-definition radioscopic imaging and AI algorithms can show whether the needles inside 
are skewed or incompliant in length. By automatically detecting faults in batches and removing faulty items, the 
solution greatly improves detection efficiency and overcomes the challenge of complicated and inefficient human 
detection. Based on a customized barcode scanning function, the barcode of each component is linked to its X-ray 
image to allow for the tracking and tracing of defective products, as an effective approach to ensuring high-quality 
production. 
X-ray foreign matter detectors: Food safety has always been a topic of great social concern. For example, it 
is difficult to identify tiny bone fragments during the quality control of chicken breast. HikRayin's X-ray dual-
energy intelligent foreign matter detection system employs X-ray detection, the new Raytina image enhancement 
engine, artificial intelligence technology and a dual-energy detection algorithm to detect the density and substance 
of a product and accurately identify bone fragments. Paired with an automated removal system, the efficient 
detection solution serves as a booster for productivity and quality assurance in factories.

2.1.5 Spectral fusion perception 
Harnessing its full-spectrum sensing technology, Hikvision has established a material composition analysis 
and detection system that identifies the type of a material, detects its safety, and identifies environmental pollution 
through a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the composition, structure, and properties of the material. By 
advancing the visible light and multi-spectral fusion technology, the Company drives the digital upgrade of 
environmental monitoring and production quality control through full-domain sensing capabilities, and helps 
customers improve production processes and productivity. In 2024, Hikvision continued to expand its spectral 
product portfolio by launching a new color detection range and miniaturized TDLAS (tunable diode laser absorption 
spectroscopy) products designed specifically for industrial enterprises, contributing to improved production 
processes and higher production safety.  
Color detection: In the manufacturing process, color detection, as a key stage for product quality control, 
quantifies color differences to check if products meet standards. Hikvision has launched two series of color detection 
products. The automatic liquid absorbance analyzer acquires the absorption spectrum of a liquid through spectral 
analysis and detects the concentration, dyeing rate and other related information during production to resolve the 
problem of invisible and undetectable black box processes such as textile vat dyeing and ink feeding and help control 
the quality of the production process. The area-array multi-spectral color and color difference detection system,

responding to uncertainties with a proactive yet prudent mindset. During the reporting period, the Company 
achieved an operating income of RMB92.50 billion, reflecting a year-on-year increase of 3.53%. The net profit 
attributable to shareholders of the listed Company amounted to RMB11.98 billion, representing a year-on-year 
decline of 15.10%. The proportion of innovative businesses in the overall business mix continued to rise, with key 
divisions such as HikRobot, Ezviz, and HikMicro achieving leading positions in their respective fields, providing

December 31, 2024, consolidated and parent company's income statement, cash flow statement and statement of changes 
in owners' equity of 2024 as well as relevant financial notes to financial statements. 
In our opinion, the financial statements annexed have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Standards for 
Business Enterprises in all material respects and they present fairly the consolidated and parent company's financial 
position of Hikvision as of December 31, 2024 and consolidated and parent company's financial performance and cash 
flows of 2024. 
2. Basis of Opinion 
We have conducted our audit in accordance with the Auditing Standards for Chinese Certified Public Accountants. 
""Responsibilities of Certified Public Accountants for Financial Statements Audit"" in the audit report further states our 
responsibilities under the standards. As per the code of ethics of Chinese certified public accountants, we are independent 
from Hikvision and have implemented other responsibilities as required by the code of ethics. We believe that the audit 
evidence we have acquired is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 
3. Key Matters 
Key matters are matters we deem the most significant to the financial statements audit for this year based on our 
professional judgment. These matters are handled based on the financial statements audit as a whole and the audit opinion 
formed accordingly. We don't present opinions separately on these matters. We confirm that the following matters are key 
matters to be communicated through in the audit report. 
 
(1) Recognition of Sales Revenues 
 
Description:
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
220 
As shown in Note (V) 45, the operating revenue in the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year 
ended December 31, 2024 is RMB92,495,525,118.30. The product sales revenue, a key performance indicator, reaches 
RMB87,408,184,677.06, accounting for 94.50% of the operating revenue, which is a significant indicator of the Group 
and has a significant influence on results of business operations. The product sales revenue include different sales models 
such as product domestic sales and product export sales by domestic companies and the overseas sales of overseas 
subsidiaries, and the revenue recognition is complicated. Therefore, we regard the occurrence of product sales revenue as 
a key audit matter. 
 
Audit Measures: 
Main audit procedures that we perform for the aforesaid key audit matters include: 
(1) Understanding and evaluating design and implementation of key internal control in relation to revenue recognition, 
and testing the effectiveness of its operation; 
(2) For revenues under different sales models, selecting a sample to check the sales contract, reviewing its main 
transaction terms, evaluating whether revenue recognition complies with requirements of accounting policies of the 
Group and the Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises;  
(3) Analyzing revenues and gross profits based on product types, to understand whether there are abnormal fluctuations 
in the revenues and gross profits for the year, and conducting a test of details for identified specific transactions, 
through systematic analysis of revenue data, and reviewing relevant supporting documents; 
(4) Selecting sample(s) from product sales revenues recorded for the year, checking invoices, sales contracts or orders, 
shipping orders, signature forms, and other supporting documents; for the sample(s) of income under the export model 
of the selected domestic companies, additional inspections will be made to the customs declaration record and 
shipment record. 
 
(2) Provision for Credit Loss of Accounts Receivable 
Description: 
As disclosed in Note (V) 4 to the consolidated financial statements of the Group, as of December 31, 2024, the balance 
of accounts receivable amounted to RMB41,824,083,460.37, and the balance of provision for credit losses of accounts 
receivable amounted to RMB3, 913,954,724.95. The book value of the Group's accounts receivable is relatively high, and 
the provision for credit loss of accounts receivable has a significant impact on the financial statements. As shown in Note 
(III) 11.2, Note (III) 13 and Note (III) 35 of the financial statements, the Group makes provisions for credit losses for 
accounts receivable at an amount equivalent to expected credit losses during the entire duration. For accounts receivable 
with significant individual amount and when the debtor has major financial difficulties, etc., the Group recognizes its credit 
losses based on individual assets, and classifies other accounts receivable into different combinations based on common 
credit risk characteristics and calculates expected credit losses on a portfolio basis. 
For accounts receivable classified into portfolios, the Group uses impairment matrix to determine the expected credit 
loss provision for accounts receivable. The expected credit loss provision ratio for each portfolio is determined based on 
the Group's historical overdue ratio and default and with reference to the forward-looking information of the industry. The 
accounting estimates above are subject to a high level of uncertainties. Therefore, we identify the recognition of credit loss 
provision for accounts receivable on a portfolio basis as a key audit matter. 
 
Audit Measures:
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
221 
Main audit procedures that we perform for the aforesaid key audit matters include: 
(1) Understanding and evaluating design and implementation of key internal control in relation to expected credit loss 
provision for accounts receivable by the Group, and testing the effectiveness of its operation; 
(2) Understanding the Group's accounting policies for expected credit loss on accounts receivable; for the model credit 
loss provision for accounts receivable on a portfolio basis, the following main procedures were performed 
-Assessing the rationality of measurement method by using impairment matrix model, and the rationality of the key 
parameters and assumptions used in the impairment matrix model, including classification of different portfolios, 
classification of stage, forward-looking adjustment, etc.; 
- Obtaining the historical default data used by the Group's management in determining the historical loss rate of 
accounts receivable, and evaluating the accuracy thereof; 
- Selecting samples to test the accuracy of the classification of portfolio and stage by the Group's management; 
- Recalculating the expected credit loss provision based on default loss percentage. 
4. Other Information 
Management of Hikvision shall be responsible for other information. Other information includes the information 
covered in the annual report, excluding the financial statements and our audit report. 
Our audit opinion on the financial statements does not cover other information and we do not express any form of 
authentication conclusion on other information.  
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read other information and to consider 
whether other information is significantly misstated or materially inconsistent with the financial statements or the 
information we learned during the audit. 
Based on the works we have performed, if we determine that there is a material misstatement in other information, 
we should report the fact. In this respect, we have nothing to report. 
5. Responsibility of the Management and Governance for the Financial Statements 
The management of Hikvision is responsible for the preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises to achieve fair presentation, and design, implementation and maintenance 
of necessary internal control to enable the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error.  
When preparing the financial statements, the management is responsible for assessing the going-concern ability of 
Hikvision, disclosing issues related to going-concern as applicable, and applying going-concern assumptions, unless the 
management plans to liquidate Hikvision, terminate operation or has no other realistic choice.  
The governance is responsible for supervising financial reporting processes of Hikvision. 
6. Responsibility of Certified Public Accountants on Audit of the Financial Statements 
Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the overall financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue audit report that contain audit opinions. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but could not guarantee that an audit performed in accordance with the Auditing Standards can 
always figure out any existing material misstatements. Misstatements may be caused by fraud or error. Misstatement is
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
222 
generally considered to be material if it is reasonably expected that the misstatement, alone or aggregated, may affect the 
users' financial decisions based on the financial statements. 
In performing the audit in accordance with the Auditing Standards, we applied professional judgment and maintained 
professional skepticism. Meanwhile, we also perform the following duties:  
(1) Identify and evaluate the risk of material misstatement of financial statements due to fraud or error; design and 
implement audit procedures to cope with these risks, and obtain adequate and appropriate audit evidence as the basis 
for expressing audit opinions. As fraud may involve collusion, forgery, willful omission, misrepresentation or 
override of internal control, the risk of not discovering a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of 
not discovering a material misstatement due to error. 
(2) Understand the internal control related to auditing as a way to design appropriate audit procedures.  
(3) Evaluate the properness of accounting policy selected by the management and the rationality of accounting estimate 
and related disclosure. 
(4) Reach a conclusion on whether the going concern assumption adopted by the management is appropriate. Meanwhile, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, reach a conclusion on whether there are material uncertainties in the events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubts on Hikvision's ability to continue as a going concern. If we reach a 
conclusion that there is a material uncertainty, the Auditing Standards require us to call the attention of the users of 
the report to the relevant disclosures in the financial statements in the audit report. If the disclosure is insufficient, we 
should issue modified audit opinions. Our conclusion is based on the information available up to the date of the audit 
report. However, future events or conditions may result in the failure of Hikvision to continue as a going concern. 
(5) Evaluate the overall presentation (including the disclosure), structure and content of the financial statements and 
evaluate whether the financial statements fairly reflect the related transactions and events. 
(6) Obtain adequate and appropriate audit evidence on the financial information of entity or business activities of 
Hikvision so as to express audit opinions on the financial statements. We are responsible for directing, supervising 
and executing the audit on the Group, and assume full responsibility for the audit opinions. 
We communicated with the governance about the scope of the audit, the schedule and major audit findings, including 
the notable shortcomings of internal control identified during the auditing.  
We also provide statement to the governance on the independence-related work ethics we follow, and communicate 
with the governance on all relations and other matters that might be reasonably deemed to influence our independence as 
well as relevant precautionary measures (as applicable).  
We determine which of the matters we communicated with the governance are of the greatest importance to the audit

Bookkeeping base and valuation principles
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
237 
The Group measures the accounting elements in accordance with the accrual accounting basis. Except certain financial 
instruments are measured by fair value, these financial statements are prepared in accordance with the measurements basis 
of historical costs. If the asset decreases in value, the provision for impairment of assets should be made according to 
relevant regulations. 
 
According to the historical cost measurement, the assets shall be measured as per the amount of cash or cash equivalent 
paid at the time of purchase, or the fair value of consideration paid for the purchase of such assets. The liabilities shall be 
measured in accordance with the amount of funds or assets actually received when undertaking current obligations, or the 
contract amount when undertaking the current obligations, or the amount of cash or cash equivalents required for paying 
back the debts in daily activities.  
 
The fair value is a price received by the market participants from selling asset or transferring liability during orderly 
transaction at the measurement date. No matter the fair value is observable or estimated by using valuation technique, the 
measured and disclosed fair value in the financial statement shall be determined on this basis.  
 
When measuring non-financial assets at fair value, the assets shall be measured considering the ability of market 
participants to use the assets for optimal use to generate economic benefits, or to sell the assets to other market participants 
to use the assets for optimal use to generate economic benefits. 
 
For the financial assets measured with transaction price at the initial recognition, and the use of valuation techniques 
involving unobservable inputs in the subsequent fair value measurement, the valuation technique is corrected in the 
valuation process in order to make the initial recognition results confirmed by valuation techniques equal to the transaction 
price. 
 
Based on the observable extent of the input value of the fair value, and the importance of such input value to the fair value 
measurement, the fair value measurement is divided into three levels:  
• Level 1: The input value is the unadjusted offer of the same assets or liabilities on active market acquired on measurement 
date;  
• Level 2: The input value is the input value of relevant assets or liabilities observable directly or indirectly in addition to 
level 1 input value;  
• Level 3: The input value is the non-observable input value of relevant assets or liabilities.

6. The Accounting Treatment of Business Combinations Involving Enterprises under Common Control and 
Business Combinations Not Involving Enterprises under Common Control 
Business combinations are classified into business combinations involving enterprises under common control and business 
combinations not involving enterprises under common control. 
 
6.1 Business combinations involving enterprises under common control 
 
A business combination involving enterprises under common control is a business combination in which all of the 
combining enterprises are actual controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the combination, and that 
control is not transitory. 
 
Assets and liabilities obtained shall be measured at their respective carrying amounts as recorded by the combining entities 
at the date of the combination. The difference between the carrying amount of the net assets obtained and the carrying 
amount of the consideration paid for the combination is adjusted to the share premium in capital reserve. If the share 
premium is not sufficient to absorb the difference, any excess shall be adjusted against retained earnings. 
 
Costs that are directly attributable to the combination are charged to profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
 
6.2 Business combinations not involving enterprises under common control and goodwill 
 
A business combination not involving enterprises under common control is a business combination in which all of the 
combining enterprises are not actual controlled by the same party or parties before and after the combination. 
 
The cost of combination is the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of the assets given, liabilities incurred 
or assumed, and equity securities issued by the acquirer in exchange for control of the acquiree. If a business combination 
not under the common control is realized step by step through multiple transactions, the cost of the combination is the sum 
of the consideration paid on the purchase date and the fair value of the equity of the purchase already held before the 
purchase date on the purchase date. The intermediary expenses incurred by the acquirer in respect of auditing, legal
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
240 
services, valuation and consultancy services, etc. and other associated administrative expenses attributable to the business 
combination are recognized in profit or loss when they are incurred. 
 
The acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, acquired by the acquirer in a business combination, 
that meet the recognition criteria shall be measured at fair value at the acquisition date. 
 
Where the cost of combination exceeds the acquirer's interest in the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets, the 
difference is treated as an asset and recognized as goodwill, which is measured at cost on initial recognition. Where the 
cost of combination is less than the acquirer's interest in the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets, the acquirer 
firstly reassesses the measurement of the fair values of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
and measurement of the cost of combination. If after that reassessment, the cost of combination is still less than the 
acquirer's interest in the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets, the acquirer recognizes the remaining difference 
immediately into profit or loss for the current period. 
 
Goodwill arising on a business combination is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, and is presented 
separately in the consolidated financial statements.  
 
7. Criteria for determining control right and Preparation Method of Consolidated Financial Statements 
7.1 Criteria for determining control right 
 
Control right means that an investor may control an investee; the investor may participate in relevant activities of the 
investee to obtain variable rewards and also be able to use the control rights for the investee to influence its amount of 
returns. The Group will re-evaluate, if the change of the relevant facts and circumstances leading to the change of the 
relevant elements involved in the above definition of control.  
 
7.2 Preparation method of consolidated financial statements  
 
The scope of consolidated financial statements shall be confirmed based on the control. 
 
The merger of subsidiary starts from the Group obtaining the control power of the subsidiary, and terminates when the 
Group loses the control power of the subsidiary.
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
241 
As for subsidiaries disposed by the Group, operating results and cash flows prior to the disposal date (the date of losing 
control right) have been properly included in the consolidated profit statement and consolidated cash flow statement.  
For a subsidiary acquired through a business combination not involving enterprises under common control, the operating 
results and cash flows from the acquisition date (the date when control is obtained) are included in the consolidated income 
statement and consolidated statement of cash flows.  
 
No matter when the business combination occurs in the reporting period, subsidiaries acquired through a business 
combination involving enterprises under common control are included in the Group's scope of consolidation as if they had 
been included in the scope of consolidation from the date when they first came under the common control of the actual 
controlling party. Their operating results and cash flows from the beginning of the earliest reporting period are included 
in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows, as appropriate. 
 
The significant accounting policies and accounting periods adopted by the subsidiaries are determined based on the 
uniform accounting policies and accounting periods set out by the Company. 
 
All significant intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation. 
 
The portion of subsidiaries' equity that is not attributable to the Company is treated as minority interests and presented as 
""minority equity"" in the consolidated balance sheet. The portion of net profits or losses of subsidiaries for the period 
attributable to minority interests is presented as ""minority interests"" in the consolidated income statement below the ""net 
profit"" line item. 
 
When the amount of loss for the period attributable to the minority shareholders of a subsidiary exceeds the minority 
shareholders' portion of the opening balance of owners' equity of the subsidiary, the excess amount are still allocated 
against minority interests. 
 
Acquisition of minority interests or disposal of interest in a subsidiary that does not result in the loss of control over the 
subsidiary is accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the total owners' equity attributable to owner 
of the Company and minority equity are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. The 
difference between the amount by which the minority interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or 
received is adjusted to capital reserve under owners' equity. If the capital reserve is not sufficient to absorb the difference, 
the excess is adjusted against retained earnings.
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
242 
In the case that the equity of the acquiree is obtained through multiple deals in stages to finally form the business 
combination not under the common control, the business combination shall be handled differently based on whether it is 
""package deal"": where it is package deal, the Company accounts each deal as a deal to obtain the control. If the deal is not 
a ""package deal"", a deal where the control is obtained on the acquisition date will be subject to accounting. The acquiree's 
equity held before the acquisition date will be re-measured based on the fair value of the equity on the acquisition date 
and the difference between the fair value and book value will be included in the profit or loss in the current period. If the 
acquiree's equity held before the acquisition date involves any changes in the other comprehensive income or in any other 
owner's equity accounted by the equity method, then it is transferred to income for the period in which it belongs at the 
date of purchase. 
8. Joint Arrangement Classification and Joint Operation Accounting 
Joint arrangements include joint operation and joint ventures. Such classification is defined based on the rights and 
obligations of the joint parties in the joint arrangement, taking into account the structure and legal form of such 
arrangement and also the contractual provisions.  
 
The Groups investment in any joint venture is accounted by the equity method. See the details in Note (III) ""18.3.2 Long-
term equity investment accounted under the equity method"".  
 
9. Recognition Criteria of Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash comprises cash on hand and deposits that can be readily withdrawn on demand. Cash equivalents are the Group's 
short-term (Generally refers to due within three months from the purchase date), highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
10. Conversion of Transactions and Financial Statements Denominated in Foreign Currencies.  
10.1 Transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
 
A foreign currency transaction is recorded, on initial recognition, by applying an exchange rate that approximates the 
actual spot exchange rate on the date of transaction; The exchange rate that approximates the actual spot exchange rate on 
the date of transaction is calculated according to the middle price of market exchange rate at the beginning of the month 
in which the transaction happened. 
 
At the balance sheet date, foreign currency monetary items are translated into [RMB] using the spot exchange rates at the 
balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising from the differences between the spot exchange rates prevailing at the
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
243 
balance sheet date and those on initial recognition or at the previous balance sheet date are recognized in profit or loss for 
the period, except for exchange differences related to a specific-purpose borrowing denominated in foreign currency that 
qualify for capitalization are capitalized as part of the cost of the qualifying asset during the capitalization period. 
 
When the consolidated financial statements include foreign operation(s), if there is foreign currency monetary item 
constituting a net investment in a foreign operation, exchange difference arising from changes in exchange rates are 
recognized as ""exchange differences arising on conversion of financial statements denominated in foreign currencies "" in 
other comprehensive income, and in profit and loss for the period upon disposal of the foreign operation. 
 
Foreign currency non-monetary items measured at historical cost are converted to the amounts in functional currency at 
the spot exchange rates on the dates of the transactions.  
 
10.2 Conversion of financial statements denominated in foreign currencies 
 
For the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statements, financial statements of a foreign operation are 
converted from the foreign currency into RMB using the following method: assets and liabilities on the balance sheet are 
translated at the spot exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date; shareholders' equity items are converted at the 
spot exchange rates at the dates on which such items arose; all items in the income statement as well as items reflecting 
the distribution of profits are translated at exchange rates that approximate the actual spot exchange rates on the dates of 
the transactions; The difference between the converted assets and the aggregate of liabilities and shareholders' equity items 
is recognized into other comprehensive income and shareholders' equity. 
 
The foreign currency cash flows and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries adopt the exchange rate similar to the spot rate at 
the date of cash flows for conversion. The affected amount of cash and cash equivalents due to the change of exchange 
rate, as an adjustment item, shall be separately listed as ""the impact of cash and cash equivalents due to the change of 
exchange rate"" in the cash flow statement.  
 
The closing balances of the prior year and the actual amount of the prior year are presented at the converted amounts of 
the prior year's financial statements. 
 
On disposal of the Group's entire interest in a foreign operation, or upon a loss of control over a foreign operation due to 
disposal of certain interest in it or other reasons, the Group transfers the accumulated exchange differences arising on 
conversion of financial statements of this foreign operation attributable to the owners' equity of the Company and presented 
under shareholders' equity, to profit or loss in the period in which the disposal occurs.

Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
244 
 
In case of a disposal or other reason that does not result in the Group losing control over a foreign operation, but only a 
decrease in proportion of overseas business interests, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences arising 
on conversion of financial statements are re-attributed to minority interests and are not recognized in profit and loss under 
current period. For partial disposals of equity interests in foreign operations, which are associates or joint ventures, the 
proportionate shares of the accumulated exchange differences arising on conversion of financial statements of foreign 
operations is reclassified to profit or loss under current period. 
 
11. Financial Instruments 
The Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability when it becomes a party to a contract of financial instrument. 
 
For the purchase or sale of a financial asset in conventional manner, the asset to be received and the liability to be assumed 
will be recognized on the trading day, or the asset sold will be derecognized on the trading day. 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured by fair value upon initial recognition (The method of determining 
the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is described in the related disclosure of the basis of accounting 
and valuation principles in note (ii). For financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, the 
relevant trading costs will be directly charged to profit and loss of the current period. For other types of financial assets 
and financial liabilities, the relevant trading costs will be booked into the initial recognition amount. Upon initial 
recognition of accounts receivable which have no material financing components or have not taken into consideration the 
financing components in contracts with a term not exceeding one year according to Accounting Standards for Business 
Enterprise No. 14 – Revenue (""Revenue Standard""), such initial amount is measured by the transaction price as defined 
under the Revenue Standard. 
 
Effective interest rate method refers to the method of calculating the amortized cost of financial asset or financial liability 
and apportioning interest income or interest expenses to each accounting period. 
 
Effective interest rate refers to the interest rate used for discounting the estimated future cash flows of a financial asset or 
a financial liability for an expected subsisting period into the balance of book value of the financial asset or the amortized 
cost of the financial liability. When determining the effective interest rate, the expected cash flows are estimated on the 
basis of considering all contractual terms of the financial asset or financial liability (such as early repayment, extended 
term, call option or other similar option) but without considering the expected credit loss.
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
245 
The amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability refers to the initial recognition amount of such financial asset 
or financial liability, less the repaid amount of principal, plus or minus the accrued amortized amount calculated by 
amortization of the difference between the initial recognition amount and the amount on maturity by using the effective 
interest rate method, and then deducts the accrued provision for losses (only applicable to financial assets). 
 
11.1 Classification, Confirmation and Measurement of Financial Assets  
 
After initial recognition, the Group will adopt amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value 
through profit and loss for subsequent measurement depending on different categories of financial assets. 
 
The Group will classify a financial asset into a financial asset measured at amortized cost if the contractual terms of the 
financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding and the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in 
order to collect contractual cash flows. Financial assets classified by the Group as financial asset measured by amortized 
cost include cash and cash equivalents, notes receivables and accounts receivable, other receivables, long-term receivables 
and other non-current assets. 
 
The Group will classify a financial asset into a financial asset measured by fair value through other comprehensive income 
if the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal 
and interest on the principal amount outstanding, and the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective 
is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets. This category of financial assets 
mainly includes financial assets with a maturity of more than one year from the date of acquisition and which are presented 
under other debt investments, financial assets maturing within one year (inclusive) from the balance sheet date and which 
are presented under non-current assets maturing within one year, as well as the notes receivable classified as fair value at 
the time of acquisition and their changes are included in other comprehensive income are listed in the receivables for 
financing, and for those have acquisition period within one year (including one year) are listed in other current assets. 
 
At the time of initial recognition, the Group may, on the basis of a single financial asset, irrevocably designate an 
investment in an equity instrument held for non-trading purpose recognized or without consideration in a business 
combination of enterprises not under the same control as a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income. 
This type of financial assets is presented as investment in other equity instruments.  
 
Financial assets which have satisfied one of the following conditions indicate that such financial assets are held for trading 
purpose by the Group: 
• 
The purpose of acquiring the relevant financial asset is mainly for sale in recent period. 
• 
At the time of initial recognition, the relevant financial asset is a part of an identifiable portfolio of financial
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
246 
instruments under collective management, and there is objective evidence showing a recent and actual existence of short-
term profitable mode.  
• 
The relevant financial assets are derivatives. 
 
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss include financial assets which are classified as financial assets at fair 
value through profit and loss and financial assets designated at fair value through profit and loss:  
• 
Financial assets which do not satisfy the conditions of being classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost 
or as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, they will be classified as financial assets at fair 
value through profit and loss. 
• 
At the time of initial recognition, in order to eliminate or substantially reduce mismatch in accounting, the Group 
may irrevocably designate a financial asset as a financial asset measured at fair value with changes through profit and loss.  
 
Financial assets measured at fair value with changes recognized in profit or loss, other than derivative financial assets, are 
presented as trading financial assets. If such financial assets have a maturity of more than one year from the balance sheet 
date (or without a fixed maturity) and which are expected to be held for more than one year, they will be presented under 
other non-current financial assets.  
 
11.1.1 
Financial assets measured at amortized cost 
 
Financial assets measured at amortized cost adopt the effective interest rate method for subsequent measurement according 
to amortized cost, the profit or loss when impairment occurs or upon derecognition will be accounted in profit and loss of 
the current period.  
 
The Group recognizes interest income by using effective interest rate method for financial assets measured at amortized 
cost. The Group determines interest income by multiplying the balance of book value of financial assets with the effective 
interest rate except under the following circumstances: 
• 
For acquired or generated financial assets which incurred credit impairment already, their interest income will be 
determined by using the amortized cost of such financial asset calculated with the credit adjusted effective interest rate.  
• 
For acquired or generated financial assets which have not incurred credit impairment but incur credit impairment in 
the subsequent period, the Group will determine their interest income by using the amortized cost of such financial assets 
multiplied with the effective interest rate in the subsequent period. If such financial asset ceases to have credit impairment 
due to improvement in credit risk in the subsequent period, then the Group should change to multiply the effective interest 
rate with the balance of book value of such financial asset instead to determine the interest income.  
  
11.1.2 
Financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income 
 
The impairment loss or profit, or interest income calculated by using the effective interest rate method, relating to financial
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
247 
asset at fair value through other comprehensive income should be accounted in the profit and loss of the current period, 
and other changes in fair value of such financial assets will be accounted in other comprehensive income. The amount 
charged by such financial asset to the profit and loss of each period is deemed to be equal to the amount which has been 
measured by amortized cost and charged to the profit and loss of each period. Upon derecognition of such financial asset, 
the accumulated profit or loss previously charged to other comprehensive income will be reversed from other 
comprehensive income and charged to profit and loss of the current period.   
 
For non-trading equity instrument investment designated at fair value through other comprehensive income, its changes 
in fair value will be recognized in other comprehensive income. Upon derecognition of such financial asset, the 
accumulated profit or loss charged to other comprehensive income will be reversed from other comprehensive income and 
charged to retained earnings. During the period when such investment in equity instruments for non-trading purpose are 
held by the Group, the right to receive dividends by the Group has been established, and economic benefits related to 
dividends are likely to flow into the Group, and if the amount of dividends may be measured reliably, the dividend income 
is recognized and accounted in the profit and loss of the current period.  
 
11.1.3 Financial asset at fair value through profit and loss 
 
For financial asset at fair value through profit and loss, subsequent measurement will be calculated at fair value, the profit 
or loss arising from changes in fair value and the dividend and interest income relating to such financial asset will be 
accounted in the profit and loss of the current period.  
 
11.2 Impairment of Financial Assets 
 
For financial assets measured at amortized cost, financial assets that are classified as financial asset at fair value through 
other comprehensive income, lease receivables and contract assets, the Group will handle impairment on the basis of 
expected credit loss and recognize loss provision.  
 
The Group's consideration of contract assets, notes receivable and accounts receivable that are generated by transactions 
regulated by revenue standards and do not contain significant financing components or that do not consider financing 
components in contracts that are not more than one year old, as well as those lease receivables formed from transactions 
that are defined by the Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 21-Leasing, the loss reserve shall be measured 
based on the amount of the expected credit loss during the entire duration.  
 
For other financial instruments, other than acquired or generated financial assets which have incurred credit impairment 
already, the Group will assess on each balance sheet date the changes in credit risk of the relevant financial instruments 
since initial recognition. If the credit risk of such financial asset has significantly increased after initial recognition, the 
Group will calculate its loss provision based on the amount equivalent to the expected credit loss for the entire subsisting
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
248 
period. If the credit risk of such financial asset since initial recognition has not increased significantly, the Group will 
calculate its loss provision according to the expected credit loss amount of such financial asset for the next 12 months. 
The amount of increase or reversal in the provision for credit loss, apart from financial assets classified as financial asset 
at fair value through other comprehensive income, is accounted in the profit and loss of the current period. For financial 
asset classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the Group will recognize its credit loss 
provision in other comprehensive income and charged the impairment loss or gain to the profit and loss of the current 
period, and will not decrease the book value of such financial asset presented in the balance sheet.  
 
The Group has calculated the loss provision equivalent to the expected credit loss amount for the entire subsisting period 
of the financial instrument in the preceding accounting period, but at the balance sheet date of the current period, such 
financial instrument is no longer under the condition of significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the 
Group calculates the loss provision for such financial instrument on the balance sheet date of the current period according 
to an amount equivalent to the expected credit loss for the next 12 months, and the resulting loss provision reversal amount 
will be counted as impairment gain and booked into the profit and loss of the current period.  
  
11.2.1 Significant increase in credit risk 
 
The Group uses available and reasonable forward-looking information with justification, by comparing the default risk of 
the financial instrument at the balance sheet date with the default risk on the initial recognition date, to confirm whether 
the credit risk of the financial instrument has significantly increased after initial recognition. 
 
The Group considers the following factors when assessing whether the credit risk has significantly increased: 
(1) Whether a significant change has been caused to the internal price indicator due to changes in credit risk. 
(2) Whether the external credit rating of financial instrument has actual or expected significant changes. 
(3) Whether the actual or expected internal credit rating of the debtor has been downgraded.  
(4) Whether adverse changes have occurred in the business, finance or economic conditions which are expected to cause 
significant changes in the capability of the debtor to perform debt repayment obligations.  
(5) Whether actual or expected significant changes have occurred in the operating results of the debtor. 
(6) Whether significant adverse changes have occurred in the supervision, economic or technical environment in which 
the debtor operates. 
(7) Whether significant changes have occurred in the value of security pledged for the debt or the quality of guarantee 
or credit enhancement provided by third parties. Such changes are expected to reduce the debtor's economic 
motivation of repayment according to contractual term or influence the probability of default. 
(8) Whether significant changes have occurred in the economic motivation which will lower the expectation of 
repayment by the borrower according to the contractual term. 
(9) Whether significant changes have occurred in the expected performance and repayment behavior of the debtor.
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
249 
Whether or not the credit risks increase significantly after the foregoing assessments, if any contractual payment for any 
financial instrument that overdue for over (including) 30 days, it indicates the credit risks of that financial instrument have 
increased significantly. 
 
On the balance sheet date, if the Group determines that the financial instrument only carries low credit risks, then it assumes 
that the credit risks of the financial instrument have not increased significantly since the initial recognition. If the risk of 
default on financial instruments is low, the borrower is highly able to perform its contractual cash flow obligations in the 
short term, and even if the economic situation and operating environment are adversely changed over a long period of time 
but not necessarily reducing the borrower's performance of its contractual cash obligations, the financial instrument is 
considered as having a lower credit risk.  
 
11.2.2  Financial assets which have incurred credit impairment already 
 
When one or more events which will have adverse effect on the expected future cash flows from the financial asset of the 
Group have occurred, such financial asset will become a financial asset which have incurred credit impairment already. 
The evidence of credit impairment occurred in a financial asset includes the following observable information:  
(1) Material financial difficulties have occurred in the issuer or debtor; 
(2) Breach of contract by the debtor, such as default or overdue for the payment of interest or repayment of principal;  
(3) Due to economic or contractual considerations relating to financial difficulties of the debtor, the creditor has granted 
concession to the debtor under no other circumstances;  
(4) The debtor is likely to go bankrupt or carry out other financial restructuring;  
(5) The financial difficulties of the issuer or debtor have caused the disappearance of the active market for the financial 
asset;  
(6) The purchase or generation of a financial asset at a large discount, such discount reflects the fact of occurrence of credit 
loss.  
 
11.2.3  Confirmation of expected credit loss 
 
The Group confirms the expected credit loss of the relevant financial instrument according to the following method: 
• 
In respect of financial asset and lease receivables, the credit loss is the present value of the difference between the 
contractual cash flow that the group should receive and the cash flow that it expects to receive. 
• 
In respect of financial assets with credit impairment on the balance sheet date but they are not acquired or generated 
financial assets with credit impairment, the credit loss represents the difference between the balance of the book value 
of such financial asset and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted by the original effective 
interest rate.  
 
The factors reflected by the method used for calculating expected credit loss of financial instruments by the Group include:
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
250 
an unbiased weighted average amount determined by assessing a series of probable outcomes; time value of currency; 
reasonable and justifiable information relating to past events, prevailing conditions and forecast of future economic 
conditions obtained on the balance sheet date without incurring unnecessary additional cost or effort.  
 
11.2.4  Write-off on financial asset 
 
When the Group ceases to have reasonable expectation on the possible collection of all or part of the contractual cash 
flows from the financial asset, the balance of book value of such financial asset will be written off directly. Such a write-
off constitutes a derecognition of the relevant financial asset.  
 
11.3 Transfer of financial asset 
 
A financial asset that fulfills one of the following conditions will be de-recognized: (1) termination of contractual rights 
to receive cash flows from the financial asset; (2) upon transfer of such financial asset and transfer of substantially all the 
risks and rewards in respect of the ownership of such financial asset to the transferee; (3) upon transfer of such financial 
asset, though the Group has not transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards in respect of the ownership 
of such financial asset, yet it has not retained the control over such financial asset.   
 
If the Group has not transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards in respect of the ownership of such 
financial asset, and has retained the control over such financial asset, then such transferred financial asset will continue to 
be recognized, and the relevant liabilities will continue to be recognized, according to the level of the Group's continuous 
involvement in such transferred financial asset. The relevant liabilities will be measured by the Group according to the 
following method:  
• 
If the transferred financial asset is measured by amortized cost, the book value of the relevant liabilities is equivalent 
to the book value of the transferred asset of continuous involvement less the amortized cost of the rights retained by the 
Group (if the Group has retained the relevant rights due to transfer of the financial asset) and plus the amortized cost of 
the obligations undertaken by the Group (if the Group has undertaken the relevant obligations due to transfer of the 
financial asset), and the relevant liabilities are not designated as financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss of 
the current period.  
• 
If the transferred financial asset is measured by fair value, the book value of the relevant liabilities is equivalent to 
the book value of the transferred asset of continuous involvement less the fair value of the rights retained by the Group (if 
the Group has retained the relevant rights due to transfer of the financial asset) and plus the fair value of the obligations 
undertaken by the Group (if the Group has undertaken the relevant obligations due to transfer of the financial asset), and 
the fair value of the rights and obligations shall be measured at the fair value on a separate basis.  
 
For full transfer, which satisfies the conditions of derecognition, of the financial assets, the difference between the sum of 
the book value of the transferred financial assets as at the date of derecognition and the consideration received from such
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
251 
transfer and the accumulated amount of change in fair value originally included in other comprehensive income, which 
corresponds to the amount in respect of derecognition, shall be recognized in the profit and loss for the current period. If 
the transfer of the financial assets by the Group is designated as investment in equity instrument held for non-trading 
purpose measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the accumulated gains or losses previously included 
in other comprehensive income shall be transferred out from other comprehensive income and be included in retained 
earnings.  
 
For transfer in part, which satisfies the conditions of derecognition, of the financial assets, the book value of the entire 
financial assets before the transfer shall be shared between the derecognized portion and the continuous recognition portion 
at their respective relative fair value on the date of transfer, and the difference between the sum of the consideration 
received from derecognition and the accumulated amount of change in fair value originally included in other 
comprehensive income, which corresponds to the amount in respect of derecognition, and the book value of the 
derecognized portion as at the date of derecognition shall be included in the profit and loss of the current period. If the 
transfer of the financial assets by the Group is designated as investment in equity instrument for non-trading purpose 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the accumulated gains or losses previously included in other 
comprehensive income shall be transferred out from other comprehensive income and be included in retained earnings. 
 
For full transfer, which does not satisfy the conditions of derecognition, of the financial assets, the Group will continue to 
recognize the entire financial assets transferred and the consideration received as a result of the asset transfer is recognized 
as a liability when received. 
 
11.4 Classification, confirmation and measurement of financial liabilities and equity instruments  
 
Pursuant to the contractual terms of the issued financial instruments and the substantive economic condition as reflected, 
but not in legal terms only, combined with the definitions of financial liabilities and equity instruments, the Group has 
classified such financial instruments or the components thereof as financial liabilities or equity instruments upon initial 
recognition.  
 
11.4.1 Classification, confirmation and measurement of financial liabilities  
 
Financial liabilities are classified into financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss of the current period and 
other financial liabilities upon initial recognition.  
 
11.4.1.1 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss of the current period 
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss of the current period comprise of financial liabilities held for 
trading purpose (including derivatives of financial liabilities) and financial liabilities designated as measured at fair value
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
252 
through profit and loss of the current period. Except for derivatives of financial liabilities, which are presented separately, 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss of the current period are presented as financial liabilities held for 
trading.  
 
Financial liabilities that fulfill one of the following conditions suggest that the Group assumes such financial liabilities for 
trading purpose: 
• 
Assumption of the relevant financial liabilities is mainly for the purpose of the recent repurchases. 
• 
The relevant financial liabilities, upon initial recognition, are part of a portfolio of identifiable financial instruments 
under centralized management, and available objective evidence shows the recent and actual existence of a short-
term profit-making model.  
• 
The relevant financial liabilities are derivatives.  
 
Financial liabilities can be designated, upon initial recognition, by the Group as financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit and loss of the current period, provided that they have satisfied one of the following conditions: (1) such designation 
can eliminate or substantially reduce accounting mismatches; (2) managing and evaluating the performance of portfolios 
of financial liabilities, or portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities, on fair value basis and reporting internally 
to key personnel of the Group on this basis in accordance with the risk management or investment strategies specified in 
formal written documents of the Group; (3) hybrid contracts, with embedded derivatives, have satisfied the conditions. 
 
Financial liabilities held for trading purpose use fair value for subsequent measurement, gains or losses arise from changes 
in fair value and the dividends or interest expenses relating to such financial liabilities are accounted in the profit and loss 
of the current period. 
 
11.4.1.2  Other financial liabilities 
 
Excluding transfer of financial assets not complying with derecognition conditions, or financial liabilities as a result of 
continuous involvement in transferred financial assets, as well as the financial guarantee contracts, the other financial 
liabilities will be classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost, subsequent measurement will be based on 
amortized cost, gains or losses on derecognition or amortization will be accounted in the profit and loss of the current 
period.  
 
If the Group and the counterparty have revised or renegotiated the contract, this has not resulted in the derecognition of 
financial liabilities measured at amortized cost for subsequent measurement, but has caused changes in the contractual 
cash flows, then the Group should recalculate the book value of such financial liabilities, and the relevant gains or losses 
shall be accounted in the profit and loss of the current period. The recalculated book value of such financial liabilities will 
be determined by the Group by discounting the cash flows from the renegotiated or revised contract with the original effect 
interest rate of the financial liabilities. All costs or expenses incurred in the revision or renegotiation of the contract will
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
253 
be reflected in the adjusted book value of financial liabilities after such revision, and will be amortized during the 
remaining period of the revised financial liabilities.    
  
 
11.4.2 
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
 
When the existing obligations of a financial liability have been wholly or partially discharged, such financial liability or 
such part of it will be derecognized. When the Group (as borrower) and the lender enter into an agreement to undertake 
new financial liabilities for replacing the original financial liabilities, if substantive difference exists in the contractual 
terms between the new financial liabilities and the original financial liabilities, the Group should derecognize the original 
financial liabilities while at the same time recognizes the new financial liabilities.  
 
When a financial liability is wholly or partially derecognized, the difference between the book value of the derecognized 
portion and the consideration paid (including non-cash asset transferred out or new financial liabilities undertaken) will 
be accounted in the profit and loss of the current period.  
 
11.4.3 
Equity instrument 
 
Equity instrument refers to a contract which can prove the ownership of remainder interest in assets after deducting all 
liabilities of the Group. The Group issues (including refinances), repurchases, sells or cancels equity instruments for 
treatment of changes in equity. The Group will not recognize changes in the fair value of equity instruments. Trading 
expenses relating to equity transactions will be deducted from equity. 
 
The Group's distribution to holder of equity instrument is treated as profit distribution, the share dividends paid out will 
not affect the total equity of shareholders.  
 
11.5 Derivatives 
 
Derivatives include foreign exchange forward contract, among others. Derivatives are measured at fair value initially on 
the date of signing the relevant contract and will be measured at fair value for subsequent measurement.  
 
11.6 Offsetting between financial assets and financial liabilities 
 
When the Group has legal right to offset the recognized financial assets and financial liabilities, and such legal right is 
enforceable currently, while at the same time the Group plans to perform netting settlement, or to liquidate the financial 
asset and repay the financial liability at the same time, the amount after offsetting between the financial asset and financial
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
254 
liability will be presented in the balance sheet. Save as said above, the financial asset and financial liability are presented 
separately in the balance sheet without offsetting each other.  
 
11.7 Reclassification of financial instruments 
 
When the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, all affected underlying financial assets will be 
reclassified. All financial liabilities are not reclassified. 
 
The Group reclassifies financial assets and applies the prospective application method for relevant accounting treatment 
from the date of reclassification (i.e., the first day of the first reporting period after the change in the business model that 
led to the reclassification of financial assets). 
 
If the Group reclassifies a financial asset measured at amortized cost to a financial asset at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, it is measured at the fair value of the financial asset at the date of reclassification. The difference 
between the original carrying amount and the fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income. 
12. Notes receivable 
12.1 Combination category and determination basis of bad debt provision according to credit risk characteristics 
 
Except for the notes receivable for which individual credit risk assessments are conducted, the Group classifies notes 
receivable into different portfolios based on the nature of the acceptor. 
 
Portfolio categories 
Determination basis 
Bank acceptance bill 
Notes receivable with acceptors are banks 
Non-bank acceptance bill 
Notes receivable with acceptors are non-banks 
 
12.2 The criteria for determining individual provisioning for bad debts 
The Group separately assesses the credit risk of the notes receivable with a single significant amount and the debtor with 
severe financial difficulties 
13. Accounts receivable, financial lease receivables and installment receivables in long-term receivables 
13.1 Combination category and determination basis of bad debt provision according to credit risk characteristics 
 
Except for the accounts receivable for which individual credit risk assessments are conducted, the Group categorizes 
accounts receivable into Portfolio A, Portfolio B and Portfolio C based on shared risk characteristics. Common credit risk 
characteristics adopted by the Group include the geographical location and business object.

For long-term receivables, the common credit risk profile adopted by the Group includes business objects. 
 
13.2 Calculation of ageing based on age-based recognition of a portfolio of credit risk characteristics 
 
The Group uses the ageing as a credit risk characteristics, and use impairment matrix to determine the credit losses of its 
accounts receivable and long-term receivables related to the financial lease and installment collection business. The ageing 
is calculated from the end of the credit period. The ageing is calculated on a continuous basis when the terms and conditions 
of accounts receivables and long-term receivables are modified but do not result in derecognition of them. 
 
13.3 The criteria for determining individual provisioning for bad debts 
 
The Group assesses the credit risk of accounts receivable with significant individual amounts and significant financial 
difficulties of debtors and financial lease receivables and installment receivables in long-term receivables individually 
14. Receivables for Financing 
14.1 Combination category and determination basis of bad debt provision according to credit risk characteristics 
 
Except for the receivables for financing for which individual credit risk assessments are conducted, the rest of receivables 
for financing includes bank acceptance bills and certificates of accounts receivable claims. Given the low likelihood of 
incurring significant losses due to default, the Group considers that the bank acceptance bills and certificates of accounts 
receivable claims it holds do not pose significant credit risk. 
 
14.2 The criteria for determining individual provisioning for bad debts 
 
This Group individually assesses the credit risk of financing of accounts receivable where the amount is material and the 
debtor has encountered severe financial difficulties. 
15. Other receivables  
 
15.1 Combination category and determination basis of bad debt provision according to credit risk characteristics 
 
Except for other receivables for which individual credit risk assessments have been conducted, the Group categorizes other 
receivables into different groups according to the nature of the amounts, and determines credit losses on a portfolio basis.

15.2 The criteria for determining individual provisioning for bad debts  
The Group individually assesses the credit risk of other receivables that are material in amount and where the debtor has 
encountered severe financial difficulties. 
16. Inventories  
16.1 Categories of inventories, valuation method, count system, amortization method for low cost and short-lived 
consumable items and packaging materials 
 
16.1.1 Categories of inventories 
 
The Group's inventory mainly includes finished products, products in process, raw materials and contract performance 
costs. Inventories are initially measured at cost. Cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion 
and other expenditures incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 
16.1.2 Valuation method of inventories upon delivery 
 
The actual cost of inventories upon delivery is calculated using the moving weighted average method. 
 
16.1.3 Inventory count system 
 
The perpetual inventory system is maintained for stock system. 
 
16.1.4 Amortization method for low cost and short-lived consumable items and packaging materials 
 
Packaging materials and low cost and short-lived consumable items are amortized using the immediate write-off method. 
 
16.2 The recognition standard and accounting method of inventory falling price reserves 
 
At the balance sheet date, inventory is measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  When the net realizable 
value is lower than the cost, the inventory falling price reserves is withdrawn.
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
257 
Net realizable value is the amount of the estimated selling price of inventory in day-to-day activities less the estimated 
costs to be incurred at completion, estimated selling expenses and related taxes. The determination of net realizable 
value of inventories is based on firm evidence obtained, taking into account the purpose for which the inventories are 
held and the effect of events after the balance sheet date. 
 
After the provision for inventory depreciation, if the factors affecting the previous reduction of inventory value have 
disappeared, resulting in the net realizable value of the inventory being higher than its carrying value, the amount of the 
original provision for inventory depreciation shall be reversed, and the amount of the reversal shall be included in the 
current profit or loss. 
 
16.3 The combination category and the basis for determining the inventory falling price reserves, and the basis for 
determining the net realizable value of different categories of inventories 
 
The Group makes provision for inventory falling price reserves by inventory category for inventories with a large 
quantity and low unit price. For inventories manufactured and sold in the same region, having the same or similar use or 
purpose, and difficult to measure separately from other items, provision for inventory depreciation shall be made on a 
consolidated basis. The Group makes provision for inventory falling price reserves according to the nature and status of 
inventories. 
 
17. Contract Assets 
17.1 Method and standard for determination of contract assets 
 
Contract assets refer to the Group's right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Group has transferred 
to a customer when that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. The Group's unconditional (i.e., 
depending on the passage of time only) right to receive consideration from the customer is separately presented as 
receivables. 
 
17.2 Combination category and determination basis of bad debt provision according to credit risk characteristics 
Consistent with accounts receivable, based on common risk characteristics, the Group provides for credit losses on a 
portfolio basis and the common credit risk characteristics adopted include the geographical location and business object. 
 
17.3 The criteria for determining individual provisioning for bad debts 
 
The Group individually assesses the credit risk of contract assets that are material in amount and where the debtor has 
encountered significant financial difficulties.

18. Long-term Equity Investment 
18.1 Basis for determining joint control and significant influence over investee 
 
Control is the power to govern an entity through participating in relevant activities of the investee; the investor is able to 
obtain variable benefits from its activities, and at same time, to use the control rights on the investee to influence the 
amount of returns. Joint control means that joint control for certain arrangement in accordance with relevant agreements; 
activities relevant to the arrangement cannot be decided until obtaining the unanimous consent of parties sharing control 
right. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is 
not control or joint control over those policies. When determining whether an investing enterprise is able to exercise 
control or significant influence over an investee, the effect of potential voting rights of the investee, such as current 
convertible debts, current executable warrants, etc., held by the investing enterprises or other parties shall be considered. 
 
18.2 Determination of initial investment cost 
 
For a long-term equity, investment acquired through a business combination involving enterprises under common control, 
the shares of merged party's book value of owners' equity in the final controlling party consolidated financial statements 
obtained on the merger date shall be considered as the initial investment cost of long-term equity investment. The 
differences between the initial investment cost of long-term equity investment and the paid cash, the transferred non-cash 
assets and the book value of the assumed debts are adjusted against the capital surplus; if the capital surplus is not sufficient 
to be offset, the remaining balance is adjusted against retained earnings. In the case of issued equity securities treated as 
consolidation consideration, share of book value of owner's equity of merged party in the final controlling party 
consolidated financial statements is regarded as initial investment cost of long-term equity investments on the date of 
consolidation; capital reserve shall be adjusted in accordance with taking total nominal value of issued share as capital 
share, the difference between the initial investment cost of long-term equity investments and total book value of issued 
shares; In case the capital reserve is not enough for writing down, the retained earnings shall be adjusted.  
 
For a long-term equity investment acquired through business combination not involving enterprises under common control, 
and the merging cost confirmed on the purchased date are regarded as the initial investment cost. In the case that the equity 
of the acquiree is obtained through multiple deals in stages to finally form the business combination not under the common 
control, the business combination shall be handled differently based on whether it is ""package deal"": where it is package 
deal, the Company accounts each deal as a deal to obtain the control. If the deal is not a ""package deal"", the sum of the 
carrying amount of the equity investment of the acquiree plus the cost of the new investment shall be used as the initial 
investment cost of the long-term equity investment calculated according to the cost method. The equity originally held is

Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
259 
accounted for by the equity method, and the relevant other comprehensive income will not be accounted for the time being. 
 
The intermediate expenses made by the combining party or purchaser for audit, legal service, assessment and other 
management related expenses during the business merger should be included into the current profit and loss as it happens.  
 
Long-term equity investment obtained by other means other than long-term equity investment formed by business 
combination shall be initially measured at cost. 
 
18.3 Subsequent measurement and recognition of profit or loss 
 
18.3.1 Long-term equity investment accounted for using the cost method 
 
Long-term equity investments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the cost method in the Company's financial 
statements. A subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. 
 
The long-term equity investment accounted by the cost method shall be measured at its initial investment cost. If there are 
additional investments or disinvestments, the long-term equity investment cost shall be adjusted. Income from the 
investment in the current period shall be recognized in accordance with the cash dividends or profits declared and issued 
by the investee.  
 
18.3.2 Long-term equity investment accounted for using the equity method 
 
Except for investments in associates and joint ventures that are wholly or partly classified as holding assets for sale, the 
Group accounts for investment in associates and joint ventures using the equity method. An associate is an entity over 
which the Group has significant influence and a joint venture is an entity over which the Group can only exercise joint 
control along with other investors on the investee's net assets. 
 
Under the equity method, where the initial investment cost of a long-term equity investment exceeds the Group's share of 
the fair value of the investee's identifiable net assets at the time of acquisition, no adjustment is made to the initial 
investment cost. Where the initial investment cost is less than the Group's share of the fair value of the investee's 
identifiable net assets at the time of acquisition, the difference is recognized in profit or loss for the period, and the cost of 
the long-term equity investment is adjusted accordingly.
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
260 
 
Under the equity method, the Group recognizes its share of the net profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the 
investee for the period as investment income or loss and comprehensive income for the period, meanwhile, the book value 
of the long-term equity investment shall be adjusted; The Group shall accordingly reduce the book value of the long-term 
equity investment in terms of the part that shall be enjoyed according to the profit or cash dividends declared by the 
invested unit to be distributed; For other changes in the owners' equity of the invested unit other than net profits and losses, 
other comprehensive incomes and the profit distribution, the book value of long-term equity investment shall be adjusted 
and be included into the capital reserves. The Group shall, on the ground of the fair value of all identifiable assets of the 
invested entity when it obtains the investment, recognize the attributable share of the net profits and losses of the invested 
entity after it adjusts the net profits of the invested entity. If the accounting policies and accounting periods adopted by the 
invested unit are different from those adopted by the Group, the adjustment shall be made for the financial statements of 
the invested unit in accordance with the accounting policies and accounting periods of the Group to recognize the 
investment income and other comprehensive incomes. For the transaction incurred between the group and associated 
enterprises and joint ventures, invested or sold assets don't constitute a business, the part that doesn't achieve internal 
transaction profit or loss or belongs to the Group calculated according to the enjoyed ratio will be offset, and the profit or 
loss on investment will be confirmed on this basis. But for the unrealized loss arising from the internal transaction between 
the Group and the invested unit, if such transaction loss is defined as the impairment loss of the transferred asset, they 
cannot be offset.  
 
When the Group determines the net loss of the invested unit that shall be shared, it is necessary to write-down the book 
value of the long-term equity investment and other long-term equities substantially constituting the net investment of the 
invested unit to zero as a limit. Besides, if the Group is obliged to bear extra loss for the invested unit, it shall be necessary 
to determine provisions and record them to current investment loss in compliance with obligations expected to be assumed. 
If the invested unit realizes any net profits later, the Group shall, after the amount of its attributable share of profits offsets 
its attributable share of the un-confirmed losses, resume recognizing its attributable share of profits.  
 
18.4 Disposal of long-term equity investments 
 
On disposal of a long term equity investment, the difference between the proceeds actually received and the carrying 
amount is recognized in profit or loss for the period. 
 
19. Fixed Assets  
19.1 Recognition criteria for fixed assets
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
261 
Fixed assets are tangible assets that are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, 
or for administrative purposes, and have useful lives of more than one accounting year. A fixed asset is recognized only 
when it is probable that economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be 
measured reliably. Fixed assets are initially measured at cost. 
 
Subsequent expenditures incurred for the fixed asset are included in the cost of the fixed asset and if it is probable that 
economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group and the subsequent expenditures can be measured 
reliably. Meanwhile the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. Other subsequent expenditures are 
recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
 
19.2 Depreciation of each category of fixed assets 
 
A fixed asset is depreciated over its useful life using the straight-line method since the month subsequent to the one in 
which it is ready for intended use. The depreciation method, depreciation period, estimated residual value rate and annual 
depreciation rate of each category of fixed assets are as follows: 
 
Item

Estimated net residual value of a fixed asset is the estimated amount that the Group would currently obtain from disposal 
of the asset, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition 
expected at the end of its useful life.  
 
19.3 Other explanations 
 
If a fixed asset is upon disposal or no future economic benefits are expected to be generated from its use or disposal, the 
fixed asset is derecognized. When a fixed asset is sold, transferred, retired or damaged, the amount of any proceeds on

Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
262 
disposal of the asset net of the carrying amount and related taxes is recognized in profit or loss for the period. 
 
The Group reviews the useful life and estimated net residual value of a fixed asset and the depreciation method applied at 
least once at each financial year-end, and account for any change as a change in an accounting estimate. 
 
20. Construction in Process 
Construction in progress is measured at its actual costs. The actual costs include various construction expenditures during 
the construction period, borrowing costs capitalized before it is ready for intended use and other relevant costs. 
Construction in progress is not depreciated. Construction in progress is transferred to a fixed asset when it is ready for 
intended use. The standards and time points for carrying forward various types of projects under construction to fixed 
assets are as follows: 
Item 
Standards and timing of carry-over as fixed assets 
Buildings and Constructions 
The main construction project and supporting projects have been substantially completed 
and reached a state of practical usability. 
Equipments to be installed and 
commissioned 
Relevant equipment and other supporting facilities have been installed; after debugging, the 
equipment can maintain normal and stable operation for a period of time. 
 
21. Borrowing Costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition & construction or production of assets eligible for capitalization 
shall be capitalized when assets expenditure, borrowing costs and necessary construction or production for bringing assets 
to expected conditions for use or marketing have taken place; when construction or production of assets ready for 
capitalization reach to expected conditions for use or marketing, capitalization shall be ceased. Other borrowing expenses 
are recognized as expenses in the current period.  
 
Where funds are borrowed under a specific-purpose borrowing, the amount of interest to be capitalized is the actual interest 
expense incurred on that borrowing for the period less any bank interest earned from depositing the borrowed funds before 
being used on the asset or any investment income on the temporary investment of those funds. Where funds are borrowed 
under general-purpose borrowings, the Group determines the amount of interest to be capitalized on such borrowings by 
applying a capitalization rate to the weighted average of the excess of cumulative expenditures on the asset over the 
amounts of specific-purpose borrowings. The capitalization rate is the weighted average of the interest rates applicable to 
the general-purpose borrowings. During the capitalization period, exchange differences related to a specific-purpose
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
263 
borrowing denominated in foreign currency are all capitalized. Exchange differences in connection with general-purpose 
borrowings are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.  
 
22. Intangible Assets 
22.1 Service life and its basis for determination, estimate, amortization method or review procedure 
 
Intangible assets include land use right, intellectual property (IP), application software, and franchise, etc.  
 
An intangible asset is measured initially at cost. When an intangible asset with a finite useful life is available for use, its 
original cost is amortized over its estimated useful life using the straight-line method. The amortization method, service 
life and net residual value of various intangible assets are shown as follows:

The fees charged by the Group to those who acquire public products and services during the project operation period do 
not constitute an unconditional right to receive cash. When the PPP project assets are ready for their intended use, the 
difference between the consideration amount of the relevant PPP project assets or the amount of confirmed construction 
income and the amount of cash (or other financial assets) that is entitled to receive a determinable amount will be 
recognized as intangible assets. 
 
For an intangible asset with a finite useful life, the Group reviews the useful life and amortization method at the end of the 
year, and makes adjustments when necessary. 
 
22.2 The accounting treatment methods and the collection scope of research and development expenditure  
 
Expenditure during the research phase is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
264 
Expenditure during the development phase that meets all of the following conditions at the same time is recognized as 
intangible asset. Expenditure during development phase that does not meet the following conditions is recognized in profit 
or loss for the period.  
(1) It is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;  
(2) The Group has the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it; 
(3) The Group can demonstrate the ways in which the intangible asset will generate economic benefits, including the 
evidence of the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used 
internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset; 
(4) The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and the ability to use 
or sell the intangible asset; and 
(5) The expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development phase can be reliably measured. 
 
If the expenditures cannot be distinguished between the research phase and development phase, the Group recognizes all 
of them in profit or loss for the period. The costs of the intangible assets generated by internal development activities only 
include the total expenditure incurred from the time point when the capitalization conditions are available to the point 
when the intangible assets are used for their intended purposes; for the expenditure that already becomes an expenditure 
in the profit and loss statement before the capitalization conditions are available during development of the same intangible 
asset, no adjustment will be made.  
 
The aggregate scope of the Group's R&D expenses includes employee compensation for personnel directly engaged in 
R&D activities, materials and service fees directly consumed by R&D activities, depreciation expenses and amortization 
expenses of intangible assets for equipment and equipment used in R&D activities, intermediate testing expenses for R&D 
activities, new product design expenses, and travel, transportation and communication expenses required for research and 
test development. The Group uses the passing of feasibility studies and the completion of R&D project projects after 
evaluation as the specific criteria for classifying R&D projects into research and development phases. 
23. Long-term Assets Impairment 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that the long-term equity investment, fixed 
assets, construction in process, and intangible assets with a finite useful life may be impaired. If there is any indication 
that such assets may be impaired, recoverable amounts are estimated for such assets. Intangible assets with indefinite 
useful life and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, irrespective of whether there 
is any indication that the assets may be impaired. 
 
Recoverable amount is estimated on individual basis. If it is not practical to estimate the recoverable amount of an 
individual asset, the recoverable amount of the asset group to which the asset belongs will be estimated. The recoverable
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
265 
amount is determined by the higher of 1) net amount of fair value of the asset or asset group deducted by the disposal 
expenses; or 2) the present value of the expected future cash flows of the asset or asset group. 
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset or an asset group is less than its carrying amount, the deficit is accounted as an 
impairment provision and is recognized in profit or loss for the period. 
 
Goodwill impairment test shall be conducted at the end of each year at least. Goodwill impairment test shall be conducted 
in accordance with the concerned asset group or asset portfolio. That is to allocate the book value of goodwill to the asset 
group or asset portfolio that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination in a reasonable way from the date 
of purchasing. When recoverable amount of apportion-included asset group or asset portfolio of goodwill is less than book 
value of goodwill, impairment loss shall be recognized. Firstly, amount of impairment loss shall be apportioned to the 
book value of goodwill of the said asset group or asset portfolio, and then book value of other assets, except for goodwill, 
in asset group or asset portfolio shall be abated in proportion. 
 
Once the impairment loss of such assets is recognized, it cannot be reversed in any subsequent period.  
 
24. Long-term Deferred Expenses 
 
Long-term deferred expenses are the expenses that are already incurred but will be shared in the current reporting period 
and later periods with amortization term of more than one year, mainly for the expenses on betterment of leased fixed 
assets and employee housing loan deferred interest. Long-term deferred expenses are evenly amortized in installments in 
three to five years during the expected benefit period.  
25. Contract Liabilities 
Contract liabilities refer to the obligation of the Group to transfer goods or services to customers for consideration received 
or receivable from customers. Contract assets and contract liabilities under the same contract are presented in net terms. 
 
26. Employee Compensation 
26.1 Accountant Arrangement Method of Short-term Remuneration  
 
During accounting period when the Group's employees provide services, actual short-term remuneration shall be 
recognized as the liabilities and current profit and loss or relevant asset cost. The Group's employee benefits and welfare
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
266 
are included into current profit and loss or relevant asset cost according to actual amount occurred during the period. If 
the employee benefits and welfare is non-monetary, it shall be measured according to its fair value. 
 
During the accounting period that the employees service the Group, the Group pays social insurance premiums such as 
medical insurance premium, industrial injury insurance premium, maternity insurance premium and housing accumulation 
fund for its employees, as well as labor union expenditure and employee education expenses calculated and withdrawn 
according to the regulations, corresponding employee remuneration amount shall be calculated and determined in 
accordance with specified calculation and withdrawal basis and proportion to recognize corresponding liabilities and 
included into the current profit and loss or relevant asset cost.  
 
26.2 Accountant Arrangement Method of Post-employment Benefits  
 
All post-employment benefits shall be considered as the defined contribution plan.  
 
In the accounting period when the employee serves for the Group, the deposited amount calculated based on defined 
contribution plan shall be recognized as liabilities and included in the current profit and loss or relevant asset cost.  
 
26.3 Accountant Arrangement Method of the Termination Benefits 
 
Where the Group provides termination benefits, the employee remuneration liabilities caused by such termination benefits 
will be determined as the following date, whichever is earlier, and will be included in the current profit and loss: 1) When 
the Group cannot unilaterally withdraw the termination benefits provided due to labor relation cancellation plan or 
employee lay-off suggestion; or 2)when the Group determines costs or expenses in relation with the restructuring of the 
paid termination benefits.  
 
27. Provisions 
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation related to a contingency such as products quality 
assurance, etc. And it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and the 
amount of the obligation can be measured reliably. 
 
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at 
the balance sheet date, taking into account factors pertaining to a contingency such as the risks, uncertainties and time 
value of money. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision is determined by
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
267 
discounting the related future cash outflows. 
 
The Group estimates product quality guarantee deposits based on expected claim rates, maintenance and replacement costs, 
etc. 
 
28. Share-based Payment 
Share-based payment refers to a transaction in which the Group grants the equity instruments or undertakes the equity-
instrument-based liabilities in return for services from employees. The Group's share-based payment is an equity-settled 
share-based payment.  
 
28.1 Equity-settled share-based payments 
 
Equity-settled share-based payments in exchange for services rendered by employees are measured at the fair value of the 
equity instruments granted to employees at the grant date. Such amount is recognized as related costs or expenses on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in capital reserve. 
 
At each balance sheet date during the vesting period, the Group makes the best estimate according to the subsequent latest 
information of change in the number of employees who are granted with options that may vest, etc. and revises the number 
of equity instruments expected to vest. The effect of the above estimate is recognized as related costs or expenses, with a 
corresponding adjustment to capital reserve. 
 
28.2. Accounting treatment related to implementation, modification and termination of share-based payment arrangement 
 
In case the Group modifies a share-based payment arrangement, if the modification increases the fair value of the equity 
instruments granted, the Group will include the incremental fair value of the equity instruments granted in the measurement 
of the amount recognized for services received. If the modification increases the number of the equity instruments granted, 
the Group will include the fair value of additional equity instruments granted in the measurement of the amount recognized 
for services received. The increase in the fair value of the equity instruments granted is the difference between fair value 
of the equity instruments before and after the modification on the date of the modification. If the Group modifies the terms 
or conditions of the share-based payment arrangement in a manner that reduces the total fair value of the share-based 
payment arrangement, or is not otherwise beneficial to the employee, the Group will continue to account for the services 
received as if that modification had not occurred, other than a cancellation of some or all the equity instruments granted.
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
268 
If cancellation of the equity instruments granted occurs during the vesting period, the Group will account for the 
cancellation of the equity instruments granted as an acceleration of vesting, and recognize immediately the amount that 
otherwise would have been recognized over the remainder of the vesting period in profit or loss for the period, with a 
corresponding recognition in capital reserve. When the employee or counterparty can choose whether to meet the non-
vesting condition but the condition is not met during the vesting period, the Group treats it as a cancellation of the equity 
instruments granted. 
 
29. Revenue 
The Group's revenue consists of product sales revenue, engineering construction revenue and cloud services and other 
service revenue. 
 
When (or as) a performance obligation in a contract was satisfied, i.e., when (or as) the customer obtains control of relevant 
goods or services, the Group recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to that performance 
obligation. A performance obligation is the Group's commitment to transfer to a customer a good or service (or a bundle 
of goods or services) that is distinct, in a contract with the customer.  
 
The Group evaluates the contract on the commencement date of the contract, identifies the individual performance 
obligations contained in the contract and determines whether each individual performance obligation is to be performed 
over a certain period of time or at a certain point in time. Revenue is recognized over time by reference to the progress 
towards complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation if one of the following criteria is met: (1) the customer 
simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group's performance as the Group performs; (2) the 
Group's performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the Group performs; or (3) the Group's 
performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to 
payment for performance completed to date. Otherwise, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains 
control of the distinct good or service. 
 
If the contract contains two or more performance obligations, the Group allocates the transaction price to each single 
performance obligation on the contract start date in accordance with the relative proportion of the individual selling price 
of the goods or services promised by each single performance obligation. However, if there is strong evidence that the 
contract discount or variable consideration is only related to one or more (but not all) performance obligations in the 
contract, the Group allocates the contract discount or variable consideration to the relevant one or more performances 
obligation. Individual selling price refers to the price at which the Group sells goods or services to customers separately. 
Where the individual selling price cannot be directly observed, the Group comprehensively considers all relevant 
information that can be reasonably obtained, and uses the observable input value to the maximum to estimate the individual 
selling price.

The Group judges whether the Group's identity is the principal or agent when engaging in transactions based on whether 
it has control over the goods or services before transferring the goods or services to customers. If the Group is able to 
control the goods or services before transferring them to customers, the Group is the principal responsible person, and 
revenue is recognized based on the total amount of consideration received or receivable. Otherwise, the Group acts as an 
agent and recognizes revenue based on the amount of commission or handling fee to which it is expected to be entitled, 
which is determined based on the net amount of the total consideration received or receivable less the consideration payable 
to other related parties, or based on a predetermined commission amount or proportion, etc. 
 
29.1 Revenue from sale of products  
 
Product sales revenue is the revenue from sales of video surveillance products, smart home products, robotics products 
and other products of the Group. 
 
According to the contract, the Group recognizes revenue when the control of the product is transferred, that is, when the 
product is handed over to the agreed carrier or delivered to the place designated by the other party for receipt. As the 
delivery of the products to the customer represents the right to receive the contract consideration unconditionally, and the 
maturity of the payment is only subject to the passage of time, the Group recognises a receivable when the product is 
delivered to the customer. When a customer prepays for a purchase, the Group recognises the transaction amount received 
as a contractual liability until revenue is recognized when the product is delivered to the customer. 
 
There is variable consideration in the product sales contracts between the Group and its distributors. The Group determines 
the best estimate of the variable consideration based on the expected delivery time, quantity and price of the products. The 
transaction price, including variable consideration, does not exceed the amount by which the accrued recognized revenue 
is unlikely to be materially reversed at the time the relevant uncertainty is eliminated. At each balance sheet date, the 
Group re-estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price. 
 
When the Group sells products to distributors, it provides an additional purchase option under sales incentives, i.e., the 
Group's distributors can accumulate sales rebates when purchasing specific products from the Group and use them to offset 
the price of goods in future purchases. These sales rebates provide resellers with discounts on their future purchases that 
are not available to similar customers. As a result, the commitment to provide the dealer with a credit for future purchases 
is a separate performance obligation that is recognized as a contractual liability at the time of the sale transaction at the 
transaction price apportioned to the fair value of the rebate, and revenue is recognized when the reseller uses the sales 
rebate offset. 
 
The Group provides quality assurance for the products sold, and the quality assurance related to the products sold by the 
Group cannot be purchased separately, but is to assure customers that the products sold meet the established standards, so 
the Group carries out accounting treatment in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standard for Business 
Enterprises No. 13 - Contingencies.

For product sales of the Group with sales return terms attached, as the customer obtains ownership of related products, the 
Group recognizes revenue in accordance with the consideration (excluding expected refund amounts due to sales returns) 
that the Group is expected to receive due to the transfer of products or services to the customer, and recognizes expected 
liabilities in accordance with expected refund amounts due to sales returns. The remaining amount, subsequent to 
deduction of expected costs from collecting the products (including the decrease in value of the returned products), is 
recognized as an asset in accordance with the carrying amount during the expected transfer of returned products after 
deducting the costs of the above net assets carried forward. 
 
Some of the Group's product sales contracts have instalment payment clauses, and there is a significant financing 
component in the contract, the Group determines the transaction price based on the amount payable in cash when the 
customer assumes control of the products. The difference between the transaction price and the contract consideration is 
amortized using the effective interest rate method during the contract period. On the contract commencement date, the 
Group does not consider the significant financing components in the contract if the interval between the customer obtaining 
control of the products and the price being paid by the customer is not more than one year. 
 
29.2 Project construction revenue 
 
Project construction revenue is the revenue from constructions related to intelligent security solution projects and PPP 
Projects provided by the Group. 
 
For project construction, the customer is able to control the assets under construction in the course of the Group's 
performance, and the Group regards them as a performance obligation to be performed within a certain period of time, and 
the revenue is recognized according to the performance progress, unless the performance progress cannot be reasonably 
determined. 
 
The Group uses the output method to determine the progress of performance, which is to determine the progress of 
performance based on the value of engineering construction services transferred to customers. If the progress of 
performance cannot be reasonably determined and the costs incurred by the Group are expected to be compensated, 
revenue is recognized according to the amount of costs incurred until the progress of performance can be reasonably 
determined. 
 
The Group's customers make milestone payments with the Group in respect of projects in accordance with the terms of 
the contract. The Group first recognizes the completed performance obligations as contract assets and reclassifies them as 
accounts receivable when the payment milestone is reached; if the contract price received or receivable by the Group 
exceeds the accumulated performance obligations completed, the excess part is recognized as a contract liability. The 
Group's contract assets and contractual liabilities under the same contract are presented on a net basis. 
 
Some of the Group's construction contracts have long-term payment clauses, and there are significant financing elements 
in the contracts. The Group determines the transaction price on the basis of the amount payable in cash on the assumption
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
271 
that the customer will take control of the asset-building. The difference between the transaction price and the contract 
consideration is amortized over the life of the contract using the effective interest method. At the commencement date of 
the contract, the Group expects that the interval between the customer obtaining control of the service and the customer 
paying the price will not exceed one year, regardless of the significant financing component existing in the contract. 
 
The Group, as a private capital, entered into a PPP project contract with the government and provided construction, 
operation, maintenance and other services. The Group identifies construction services, operation services and maintenance 
services as individual performance obligations in the contract, and allocates the transaction price to each performance 
obligation based on the relative proportion of the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. When providing 
construction services or outsourcing projects to other parties, The identity of the Group is the principal responsible person, 
and then accounting for construction revenue to confirm the contract assets is made. After the PPP project is ready for use, 
the Group recognizes revenue related to operation and maintenance services. 
 
29.3 Cloud service and other service revenue 
 
Revenue from cloud services and other services refers to cloud services such as storage services, video services, and 
telephone services provided by the Group, maintenance services related to security projects, and other services, etc. 
 
For cloud services and other services, the economic benefits brought by the customer are obtained and consumed at the 
time of the Group's performance, and the Group regards them as a performance obligation to be performed within a certain 
period, and the revenue is recognized according to the performance progress during the period of providing services. The 
Group adopts the output approach to determine the performance progress, i.e. the performance progress is determined 
based on the value of the services transferred to the customer to the customer. The customer paid for the cloud services in 
advance at the time of purchase, so the Group recognized the cloud service payment received at the time of the transaction 
as a contractual liability, and recognized the revenue according to the performance progress during the period of the 
provision of the services. The Group presents contract assets and contract liabilities under the same contract on a net basis. 
 
For the provision of operation and maintenance services to customers, the economic benefits obtained and consumed by 
the customers at the same time as the performance of the contract by the Group shall be regarded as the performance 
obligation to be performed within a certain period of time, and the revenue shall be recognized according to the 
performance progress. The Group's customers make milestone payments with the Group for O&M services in accordance 
with the terms of the contract. The Group first recognizes completed performance obligations as contract assets and 
reclassifies them as accounts receivable when payment milestones are reached, and if the contract price received or 
receivable by the Group exceeds the accumulated performance obligations completed, the excess part is recognized as a 
contract liability. The Group's contract assets and contractual liabilities under the same contract are presented on a net 
basis. 
 
For the provision of operation and maintenance services to customers, the economic benefits obtained and consumed by 
the customers at the same time as the performance of the contract by the Group shall be regarded as the performance

Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
272 
obligation to be performed within a certain period of time, and the revenue shall be recognized according to the 
performance progress. The Group's customers make milestone payments with the Group for O&M services in accordance 
with the terms of the contract. The part of the Group that has obtained the unconditional right to receive payment is 
recognized as accounts receivable, and the remainder is recognized as contract assets, and if the contract price received or 
receivable by the Group exceeds the accumulated performance obligations completed, the excess part is recognized as a 
contract liability. The Group's contract assets and contractual liabilities under the same contract are presented on a net 
basis. 
 
30. Cost of Contract 
30.1 Cost of obtaining a contract 
 
Incremental costs incurred by the Group to obtain a contract (that is, costs that would not have occurred without a contract) 
and expected to be recovered are recognized as an asset, and amortized using the same basis as revenue recognition for 
the goods or services to which the asset relates, and included in current profit or loss. If the amortization period of the 
asset does not exceed one year, it is included in current profit or loss when it occurs. Other expenses incurred by the Group 
in order to obtain the contract shall be included in current profit or loss when incurred, unless it is clearly borne by the 
customer.  
 
30.2 Cost of contract fulfillment 
 
The cost of the Group's performance of a contract that does not fall within the scope of accounting standards other than 
the revenue standard and meets the following conditions is recognized as an asset: (1) The cost is directly related to a 
current or anticipated contract; (2) The cost increases the Group's resources for fulfilling performance obligations in the 
future; (3) The cost is expected to be recovered. The aforesaid assets are amortized on the same basis as the recognition 
of income from goods or services related to the assets, and are included in the current profit or loss. 
The Group's asset in relation to contract costs are mainly contract performance costs, and they are included in inventories 
based on their current nature. 
 
30.3 Impairment losses on assets related to contract costs 
 
In determining impairment losses on assets related to contract costs, impairment losses are first determined for other assets 
recognized in accordance with other relevant ASBEs and related to the contract. Then, for assets related to contract costs 
whose carrying value is higher than the difference between the following two items, the Group makes provision for 
impairment for the excess to be recognized as asset impairment losses: (1) the remaining amount of consideration expected 
to be obtained by the Group for the transfer of goods or services related to the asset; (2) the estimated costs to be incurred 
in connection with the transfer of such relevant goods or services.
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
273 
After provision for impairment is made for the asset related to contract costs, if the difference between the above two items 
is higher than the carrying value of the asset due to changes in the factors of impairment in previous periods, the original 
provision for impairment of the asset is reversed and included in the current profit or loss, but the carrying value of the 
asset after the reversal shall not exceed the carrying value of the asset on the reversal date assuming no provision for 
impairment is made. 
 
31. Governmental Subsidies 
Government subsidies refer to the monetary and non-monetary assets obtained by the Group from the government for free. 
Government subsidies are recognized when they can meet the conditions attached to the government subsidies and can be 
received. 
 
If a government subsidy is a monetary asset, it shall be measured at the amount received or receivable. 
 
31.1 Judgment basis and Accountant treatment of government subsidy related to assets 
 
The government subsidies for some special subsidies and etc. are used for constructions and forms long-term assets, and 
therefore are categorized as government subsidy related to assets.  
 
A government grant related to an asset is recognized as deferred income, and it should be evenly amortized to profit or 
loss over the useful life of the related asset. 
 
31.2 Judgment basis and accountant treatment of government subsidy related to income 
 
The Group receives government subsidies including subsidies for special projects and Value-Added-Tax refund, etc. which 
are used to compensate the group-related costs or losses, and therefore are categorized as government subsidy related to 
income. 
 
For a government grant related to income, if the subsidy is a compensation for related expenses or losses to be incurred in 
subsequent periods, it is recognized as deferred income, and recognized in profit or loss over the periods in which the 
related costs or losses are recognized; If the subsidy, such as VAT refund, is a compensation for related expenses or losses 
already incurred, it is recognized immediately in profit or loss for the period.

For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
274 
For government subsidies related to the Group's daily operations shall be booked into other income; for those not related 
to the Group's daily operations, shall be booked into non-operating income/expense.  
 
The policy-based preferential loan interest subsidy obtained by our group is directly allocated by the government to our 
group, and the corresponding interest subsidy offsets the relevant borrowing costs. 
 
32. Deferred Tax Assets / Deferred Tax Liabilities 
The income tax expenses include current income tax and deferred income tax.  
 
32.1. Current Income Tax 
 
At the balance sheet date, current income tax liabilities (or assets) for the current and prior periods are measured at the 
amount expected to be paid (or recovered) according to the requirements of tax laws. 
 
32.2 Deferred Tax Assets and Deferred Tax Liabilities 
 
For temporary differences between the carrying amounts of certain assets or liabilities and their tax base, or between the 
nil carrying amount of those items that are not recognized as assets or liabilities and their tax base that can be determined 
according to tax laws, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized through the balance sheet liability method. 
 
In general, all temporary differences are recognized as the relevant deferred income tax. However, for deductible 
temporary differences, the Group recognizes the relevant deferred tax assets to the extent that it is likely to obtain the 
taxable income to offset the deductible temporary differences. In addition, deferred tax assets or liabilities relating to the 
initial recognition of goodwill, as well as those arising from transactions that are neither a business combination nor affect 
accounting profits and taxable income (or deductible losses) and do not result in equal taxable and deductible temporary 
differences, are not recognized. 
 
For deductible losses and tax credits that can be carried forward, deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible losses and tax credits can be utilized. 
 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except 
where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
275 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary 
differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be taxable 
profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable 
future.  
 
On the balance sheet date, the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are measured at the applicable 
tax rates in the period in which the related assets are recovered or the related liabilities are recovered in accordance with 
the tax laws. 
 
Current and deferred tax expenses or income are recognized in profit or loss for the period, except when they arise from 
transactions or events that are directly recognized in other comprehensive income or in shareholders' equity, in which case 
they are recognized in other comprehensive income or in shareholders' equity; and when they arise from business 
combinations, in which case they adjust the carrying amount of goodwill. 
 
At the balance sheet date, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed and reduced if it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the future to allow the benefit of deferred tax assets to be utilized. Such 
reduction in amount is reversed when it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available. 
 
32.3 Offset of Income Tax  
 
When the Group has a legal right to settle on a net basis and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously, current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset and presented on a net basis. 
 
When the Group has a legal right to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, and deferred tax assets and 
deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or 
different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realize the assets 
and liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are 
expected to be reversed, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset and presented on a net basis. 
 
33. Lease  
Lease refers to a contract that conveys the right to use an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
276 
The Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the inception date. The Group does not re-assess whether 
a contract contains a lease unless the terms and conditions of the contract are changed.  
 
33.1 The Group as the lessee  
 
33.1.1 
Separating components of lease 
 
In case the contract contains one or more lease and non-lease components, the Group separates each lease component and 
non-lease component, and allocates the consideration to the lease and non-lease components based on the proportion of 
relative stand-alone prices of the components.  
 
33.1.2 
Right-of-use assets  
 
The Group recognizes the right-of-use assets for leases on the commencement date of the lease term, except for short-term 
lease and lease of low-value assets. The commencement date of the lease term refers to the date from which the lessor 
makes the leased assets available for use by the Group. Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost. The cost includes:  
 
Initial measurement amount of lease liabilities;  
 
Amount of lease payment made at or before the commencement date of the lease, less any lease incentives received;  
 
Initial direct costs incurred by the Group;  
 
An estimate of any costs to be incurred by the Group in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, or restoring 
the site on which it is located, or restoring the leased assets to the conditions as agreed under the terms of the lease, 
excluding costs incurred to produce inventories.  
 
The Group calculates depreciation of the right-of-use assets in accordance with the relevant depreciation provisions of 
Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 4 - Fixed Assets. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter 
of the lease term and the useful life of the right-of-use asset, unless there is a transfer of ownership or purchase option 
which is reasonably certain to be exercised at the end of the lease term.  
 
The Group determines whether the right-of-use assets are impaired and accounts for the identified impairment loss in 
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 8 - Impairment of Assets.  
 
33.1.3 
Lease liabilities  
 
The Group initially measures the lease liability on the commencement date at an amount equal to the present value of the 
lease payments during the lease term that are not paid at that date, except short-term lease and lease of low-value assets. 
In calculating the present value of the lease payments, the Group adopts the interest rate implicit in the lease as the discount 
rate. The Group uses its incremental borrowing rate if the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined.
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
277 
 
Lease payments refer to the payments made by the Group to the lessor in connection with the right to use the leased asset 
during the lease term, including:  
 
Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable;  
 
The exercise price of a purchase option, if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option;  
 
Payments for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising the option to terminate the lease; 
 
Amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees. 
 
After the commencement date of the lease term, the Group calculates interest expense of lease liabilities in each period of 
lease term at fixed periodic rate and recognizes in the current loss and profit or relevant asset costs.  
 
After the commencement date of the lease term, the Group remeasures the lease liability and adjusts the corresponding 
right-of-use assets under the following circumstances. If the carrying value of the right-of-use assets has been reduced to 
zero while the lease liability needs to be further reduced, the Group will recognize the difference into the current loss and 
profit:  
 
In case of any change of the lease term or any change in the valuation of the purchase option, the Group remeasures 
the lease liability at the present value calculated based on the modified lease payments and the revised discount rate;  
 
In the event of any change in the amount expected to be payable based on the residual value guarantees, the Group 
remeasures the lease liability at the present value calculated based on the changed lease payments and the original 
discount rate.  
 
33.1.4 
Basis for judgment and accounting treatment of the lessee's simplified treatment of short-term leases and leases 
of low-value assets   
 
The Group has elected not to recognize the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases and leases of low-
value assets. Short-term lease refers to lease with a term no more than 12 months from the commencement date of lease 
term and without purchase option. Lease of low-value assets refers to lease for single lease asset with low value when it 
is new. The Group recognizes lease payments under short-term leases and leases of low-value assets as the current loss 
and profit or the relevant asset costs on a straight-line basis over each period during the lease term.  
 
33.1.5 
Lease modification  
 
In case of lease modification, the Group makes accounting treatment of such lease change as a separate lease if all of the 
following conditions are met: 
 
Such lease modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more lease assets;  
 
The increased consideration is commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope and any appropriate 
adjustments to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract.
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
278 
 
Where accounting treatment is not made for lease modification as a separate lease, at the effective date of lease 
modification, the Group reallocates the contract consideration after the modification, redetermines the lease term, and 
remeasures the lease liability based on the present value calculated according to the modified lease payments and the 
revised discount rate.  
 
In the event that the lease scope is decreased or the lease term is shortened as a result of the lease modification, the Group 
reduces the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets, and recognizes the relevant gains or losses relating to the partial or 
full termination of the lease in the income statement; for the lease liabilities remeasured due to other lease modifications, 
the Group adjusts the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets accordingly.  
 
33.2 The Group as the lessor  
 
33.2.1 
Separating components of lease  
 
In case the contract contains both lease and non-lease components, the Group allocates the contract consideration in 
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 14 - Revenue on portion of 
transaction prices, based on the respective stand-alone prices of the lease component and the non-lease component.  
 
33.2.2 
Classification criteria and accounting treatment for leases as lessors  
 
Finance lease is a lease that substantially transfers all the risks and rewards of incidental to ownership of an underlying 
asset. Operating lease refers to the leases other than finance lease.  
 
33.2.2.1 The Group records the operating lease business as the lessor  
The Group recognizes the lease payments from operating leases as rental income on a straight-line basis for all periods 
over the lease term. The Group's initial direct costs incurred in connection with operating leases is capitalized as incurred, 
recognized in the income statement over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.  
 
33.2.2.2 The Group records the finance lease business as the lessor  
 
On the commencement date of the lease term, the Group uses the net lease investment as the carrying value of the finance 
lease receivables and derecognizes the finance lease assets. Net lease investment is the sum of present value of 
unguaranteed residual value and lease payments receivable discounted at the interest rate implicit in lease on the 
commencement date of the lease term.
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
279 
Lease payments receivable, which refer to amounts receivable by the Group from the lessee for conveying the right to use 
the leased assets during the lease term, include:  
 
Fixed payment including in-substance fixed payments by the lessee, less any lease incentives payable;  
 
The exercise price of a purchase option, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option;  
 
Payments for terminating the lease (if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising the option to terminate the lease; 
 
Residual value guarantees provided to the Group by the lessee, a party related to the lessee, or a third party unrelated 
to the lessor that is capable of discharging the obligations under the guarantee. 
The Group calculates and recognizes the interest income in each period of the lease term according to the fixed periodic 
interest rate.  
 
In financial leases in which the Group acts as a manufacturer or distributor as the lessor, on the commencement date of 
the lease term, the Group recognizes revenue based on the lower of the fair value of the leased assets and the present value 
of the lease receipts discounted at the market rate, and carries forward the cost of sales based on the balance of the carrying 
amount of the leased assets after deducting the present value of the unsecured residual value. 
 
The costs incurred by the Group acting as a manufacturer or distributor as a lessor to obtain a financial lease are recognized 
in profit or loss for the current period on the commencement date of the lease term. 
 
33.2.3 
Lease modification  
 
In case of modification of the operating lease, the Group accounts for it as a new lease as of the effective date of the 
modification, any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to the original lease are considered as payments for the new 
lease .  
 
In case of modification of the finance lease, the Group accounts for the modification of a finance lease as a separate lease 
if all of the following conditions are met:  
 
The modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more lease assets;  
 
The consideration for the lease increases by an amount that is commensurate with the stand-alone price for the 
increase in scope, and any appropriate adjustments to that price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract.  
 
If a modification of finance lease is not accounted for as a separate lease, the Group accounts for the changed lease under 
the following circumstances:  
 
If the modification becomes effective on the commencement date of the lease and the lease is classified as an 
operating lease, the Group accounts for it as a new lease from the effective date of the lease modification and measures 
as the net lease investment prior to the effective date of the lease modification as the carrying value of the leased 
asset.

 
If the modification becomes effective on the commencement date of the lease and the lease is classified as a finance 
lease, the Group accounts for it in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises 
No. 22 - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments regarding the modification or renegotiation of 
contracts.  
 
34. Debt Restructuring 
34.1 Recognize debt restructuring obligation as a creditor 
 
For debt restructuring carried out by modifying other terms, the Group recognizes and measures the restructured claims in 
accordance with the provisions of ASBE No. 22 - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments. 
 
35. Important Judgments while Applying Accounting Policy, and Key Assumptions and Uncertainty Factors 
Applied for Accounting Estimate 
During the process of using accounting policy described in note (III), due to the uncertainty in operation activities, the 
group should judge, estimate and assume the book value of the report items which may not be metered reliably. These 
judgments, estimates and assumptions are based on the historical experience of the Group's management and other related 
factors. Differences may exist between the actual results and the Group's estimate.  
 
The Group regularly reviews the above judgments, assumptions and estimations on the basis of continuous operation. If

- Key assumptions and uncertainties used in accounting estimate  
On balance sheet date, key assumptions and uncertainties for performing accounting estimates on book value of assets and 
liabilities in subsequent future periods are:   
Impairment provision for inventories 
Except for contract performance costs, inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. For raw 
materials, the latest or future actual purchase price is used as the basis for determining the net realizable value; For products 
in progress, the net realizable value is determined by the actual selling price of the most recent or post-period finished 
product, less the estimated costs of the current similar type at the time of completion of the product, the estimated sales 
expenses and related taxes; For finished products, the actual selling price of the latest or future finished product minus the 
estimated selling expenses and related taxes will be incurred, is used as the basis for determining the net realizable value.

The Group will regularly conduct a comprehensive stocktaking to review the impairment circumstances on defective, 
obsoleted or slow-moving inventory if any; in addition, the Group's management will regularly review the impairment 
circumstance of inventory with long storage time according to the inventory aging.. Based on the above procedure, the 
Group's management deems that the full provision amounts have been withdrawn for inventory. For details, please refer 
to Note (V) 9. 
 
Impairment of accounts receivable 
 
Except for accounts receivable whose credit losses are determined on the basis of individual basis, the Group adopts an 
impairment matrix on a portfolio basis to determine its expected credit loss of the relevant accounts receivable. The Group 
divides the risk characteristics according to the region and object of its business, and divides the relevant accounts 
receivable into different portfolios. Based on the historical loss rate and consider reasonable and well-founded forward-
looking information in the industry, the Group determines the proportion of corresponding loss reserves for different 
portfolios of various types of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2024, based on the historically loss rate and consider 
reasonable and well-founded forward-looking information in the industry, the Group determines the corresponding 
proportion of loss provision for accounts receivable. The amount of the provision for expected credit losses will change 
as the estimation of the Group. The details on the provision for expected credit losses of the accounts receivable of the 
Group are given in Note (V) 4.  
 
Useful life and predicted net residual value of fixed asset 
 
The Group's estimation of fixed assets useful life is based on the historical experience of actual usable term of fixed assets 
with similar properties and functions, the estimation of predicted net residual value is the amount obtained currently by 
the Group from the assets after deducting the anticipated disposal expense based on the anticipated status assuming the 
conditions that fixed assets' predicted useful life expires and fixed assets are at the end of useful life. The Group shall 
conduct the review on the predicted service life and predicted net residual value of fixed assets at least annually. For the 
current reporting period, the Group's management did not see signs either indicating a shortened or extended useful life of 
the Group's fixed asset or indicating a change in predicted net residual value.  
 
Accrued liabilities of product quality warranty 
 
Accrued liabilities of product quality assurance are costs and expenses incurred to meet the established standards of 
product quality assurance obligations to customers in accordance with the product contract; the Group made such an 
estimation according to the predicted claim rate, repair and replacement cost of relevant products. The management deems 
that the current estimation on accrued liabilities of product quality warranty is reasonable, however, the Group will

For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
282 
continue to review the conditions of product repairs, and will conduct adjustment if any sign indicating the need to make 
adjustments on accounting estimates.  
 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 
 
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are measured at the applicable income tax rate during the 
period when the relevant asset is expected to be recovered or the relevant debt is expected to be paid off. The expected 
applicable income tax rate is determined according to the relevant current tax regulations and the actual situation of the 
Group. If the estimated income tax rate is different from the original estimate, the management of the Group will adjust it. 
 
The realization of deferred income tax assets mainly depends on the actual future taxable income, taxable temporary 
differences, and the effective tax rate of temporary difference in the future applicable years. If the actual taxable income 
and taxable temporary differences in the future is less than the estimation, or actual tax rate is lower than the estimation, 
then the confirmed deferred income tax assets will be reversed and confirmed in the income statement during the 
corresponding period. If the actual taxable income and taxable temporary differences in the future is more than the 
estimation, or actual tax rate is higher than the estimation, then the deferred tax assets that are partially unrecognized 
deductible losses and deductible temporary differences will be recognized and confirmed in the income statement during 
the corresponding period.  
 
Goodwill impairment 
 
When testing goodwill for impairment, a pre-tax interest discount rate that appropriately reflects the current market time 
value of money and asset-specific risk is determined and the present value of the projected future cash flows of the relevant 
asset group or combination of asset groups containing goodwill is calculated. When the future actual result is different 
from the original estimation, the result of the goodwill impairment test will alter.  
 
36. Significant Alternation in Accounting Policy and Accounting Estimations 
The Ministry of Finance issued the Interpretation No. 17 of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises (the 
""Interpretation No. 17"") and No. 18 of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises (the ""Interpretation No. 18"") on 
Octorber 25, 2023 and December 6, 2024 
 
Interpretation No. 17 of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
283 
 
Interpretation No. 17 standardizes the classification of current liabilities and non-current liabilities and the accounting 
treatment of sale and leaseback transactions, which is effective from January 1, 2024. 
 
Regarding the classification of current liabilities and non-current liabilities 
 
Interpretation No. 17 has revised and improved the principles for classifying current and non-current liabilities in 
Accounting Standard for Business Enterprises No. 30 - Presentation of Financial Statements: It clarifies that if an enterprise 
does not have the substantive right to defer the settlement of a liability beyond one year from the balance sheet date, the 
liability shall be classified as a current liability. The subjective possibility of whether the enterprise will exercise the above 
right does not affect the classification of the liability's liquidity; It clarifies that for liabilities arising from loan 
arrangements of an enterprise, if the enterprise's right to defer the settlement of the liability beyond one year from the 
balance sheet date depends on contractual terms, the contractual terms to be followed by the enterprise before and on the 
balance sheet date and those to be followed after the balance sheet date should be distinguished, and whether there is the 
right to defer the settlement of the liability on the balance sheet date should be considered; It clarifies that if the 
counterparty to the enterprise's liability has the option to settle the liability with the enterprise's own equity instruments 
and this option is classified as an equity instrument and recognized separately, the relevant settlement terms are irrelevant 
to the classification of the liability's liquidity; and it clarifies the information disclosure requirements for loan arrangements 
subject to contractual terms and classified as non-current liabilities. Enterprises are also required to adjust comparative 
period information when first applying this provision. 
 
After assessment, the Group believes that the adoption of the above provisions will not have a material impact on the 
Group's financial statements. 
 
Regarding the accounting treatment of sale and leaseback transactions 
 
Interpretation No. 17 stipulates that where the transfer of assets in a sale and leaseback transaction is deemed a sale, after 
the commencement of the lease term, the lessee shall not recognize gains or losses related to the right to use obtained from 
the leaseback when determining the lease payments or the changed lease payments in the subsequent measurement of the 
lease liability arising from the sale and leaseback. Where a lease modification results in a reduction of the scope of the 
lease or a shortening of the lease term, the lessee shall recognize any gains or losses related to the partial or full termination 
of the lease in the current period profit or loss, which is not subject to the above restriction. When an enterprise first applies 
this provision, it shall retrospectively adjust the sale and leaseback transactions conducted after the first application of 
Accounting Standard for Business Enterprises No. 21 - Leases.

Interpretation No. 18 of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises 
 
Interpretation No. 18 standardizes the accounting treatment of warranty-type quality guarantees that do not constitute a 
separate performance obligation, which will be effective from December 6, 2024, and allows enterprises to apply it in 
advance from the year of issuance. 
 
Regarding the accounting treatment of warranty-type quality guarantees that do not constitute a separate performance 
obligation 
 
Interpretation No. 18 stipulates that, in accordance with Accounting Standard for Business Enterprises No. 14 - Revenue, 
when accounting for the provision recognized due to warranty-type quality guarantees that do not constitute a separate 
performance obligation, enterprises shall follow the relevant provisions of Accounting Standard for Business Enterprises 
No. 13 - Contingencies. The determined amount of the provision shall be debited to accounts such as ""Cost of Main 
Business"" or ""Other Business Costs"" and credited to the ""Provision"" account. Correspondingly, it shall be presented in the 
items of ""Total Operating Costs"" in the income statement and ""Other Current Liabilities,"" ""Non-current Liabilities Due 
within One Year,"" and ""Provisions"" in the balance sheet. When an enterprise first applies this interpretation, if the original 
recognition of warranty-type quality guarantees was recorded in ""Selling Expenses,"" the changes in the accounting 
accounts and financial statement items involved in the accounting treatment of such warranty-type quality guarantees shall 
be retrospectively adjusted as a change in accounting policy. The Group originally recorded the warranty-type quality 
guarantees in ""Selling Expenses"" and has applied this provision in advance this year. The impact on the relevant items of

(3) Goodwill impairment provision 
When the Group conducts impairment test on goodwill at the end of the reporting period, the key assumptions adopted 
and their basis are as follows: 
 
The recoverable amount of asset group portfolios containing apportioned goodwill is determined according to the present 
value of the estimated future cash flow of the relevant asset group portfolios. The forecast period for future cash flows is 
5 years. The projection of future cash flows is based on management's estimate of sales revenue, cost of sales and operating 
expenses for the expected period based on past performance and expectations of market developments. The cash flow 
growth rate over 5 years is 0-2%. 
 
During the reporting period, the Group did not find that the recoverable amount of the relevant asset group portfolios 
including the apportioned goodwill was lower than its book value, so it is considered that there is no need to accrue 
impairment loss for goodwill.

Advanced receipts from other services payment are the cloud service fees paid in advance by some customers and the part 
of the contract price received or receivable from customers for operation and maintenance according to the contract 
provisions that exceeds the cumulative completed performance obligations, and the revenue will be recognized according

Note 1: The increase of RMB1,382,239,270.18 in the share capital premium in the current period was due to the transfer 
of other capital reserves to share capital premiums due to the exercise of equity-settled share-based payments. 
 
During the current period, the Group received an international operation subsidy of RMB 2,007,056.47 from its actual 
controlling party, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (hereinafter referred to as ""CETC""). This increased 
the Group's share capital premium by RMB 1,517,235.64 and minority interests by RMB 489,820.83. Please refer to Note 
(XI), 5(4) for details. 
 
The increase in share capital premium in the current reporting period of RMB121, 444.68 is due to the Group's acquisition 
of the original minority shareholders' equity in its subsidiaries, Hua'an Security Electronics, Hua'an Security Intelligence, 
and Hua'an Security Services, resulting in the Group's ownership increasing to 100%. Please refer to Note (VII), 2(1). 
 
The increase in other capital reserves in the current reporting period of RMB798,833,409.72 is due to the equity-settled 
share-based payment; RMB329,124,946.40 was due to changes in other equity of the investees in the long-term equity 
investments accounted for by the equity method. 
 
Note 2: The decrease of RMB2,796,377,189.55 in share capital premium in the current reporting period was due to the 
repurchase and cancellation of 97,402,605 restricted shares by the Company. Please refer to Note (V) 39. 
 
The decrease of RMB 16,479,345.35 in the share premium in the current reporting period was due to the portion of equity-
settled share-based payments shared by the non-controlling interests.

Note: The increase of 310,044,296.12 shares in treasury shares during the current reporting period, is due to the repurchase 
of 10,000,219 shares through centralized bidding using its own funds, and the repurchased shares are held in the special 
securities account for share repurchase. 
 
The decrease in treasury shares includes the repurchase and cancellation of 97,402,605 restricted shares, reducing treasury 
shares by RMB 2,737,987,226.55. For more details, see Note (V), 39.

The Group adopts sensitivity analysis techniques to analyze the possible effects of rational and probable changes in risk 
variables to profit or loss for the period or to the interests of shareholders. Since risk variables seldom change on a stand-
alone basis, while the correlation between variables may have significant influence to the ultimate amount of change 
effected by the change in a single risk variable, the analysis below is based on the assumption that the changes in each 
variable occurred separately. 
 
1. Objectives, Policies and Procedures of Risk Management, and changes in the reporting period 
 
The Group engages in risk management with the aim of achieving an appropriate balance between risk and return, where 
the negative effects of risks against the Group's operating results are minimized, in order to maximize the benefits of 
shareholders and other stakeholders. Based on such objective in risk management, the underlying strategy of the Group's 
risk management is to ascertain and analyze all types of risks exposures of the Group, establish appropriate risk tolerance

Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024

thresholds, carry out risk management procedures and perform risk monitoring on all kinds of risks in a timely and reliable 
manner, thus containing risk exposures within a prescribed scope. 
 
1.1 Market risks 
 
1.1.1 Foreign exchange risks 
 
Foreign exchange risks refer to the risk that losses will occur because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company 
is primarily exposed to risks relating to the currencies such as USD, EUR and etc. The Group's subsidiaries in the mainland 
of China whose procurement, sales and financing are denominated in RMB, USD and EUR. Other principal activities are 
settled in RMB. The Group's subsidiaries in Hong Kong and outside China are principally engaged in procurement, sales, 
financing and other major business activities in local currencies such as USD, EUR and etc. 
 
As of December 31, 2024, except for monetary items of foreign currencies set out in Note (V) 61, the Group mainly 
adopted the functional currency of each of its subsidiary to present the balance of its assets and liabilities. The foreign 
exchange risks arising from assets and liabilities denominated in USD and EUR (which has been converted into RMB) as 
follows may generate significant impact on the operating results of the Group.

The Group has been paying close attention to the effect of fluctuation in exchange rate on the foreign exchange risks of 
the Group, and has purchased various financial derivative instruments, such as forward foreign exchange contracts to 
mitigate the foreign exchange risk exposure. 
 
Sensitivity analysis on exchange rate risk 
 
The sensitivity analysis of the Group's foreign exchange risk includes only monetary items denominated in foreign 
currencies and does not consider the impact of the purchased derivative financial instruments. 
With other variables unchanged, the exchange rate might float within a reasonable range, and has the following before-

(57,995,872.74) 
 
1.1.2. Interest rate risk 
 
The risk of changes in cash flow of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates exposed to the Group are primarily 
related to bank borrowings bearing floating interest rate (please refer to Note (V) 24) and Note (V) 34) and bank deposits
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report        
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
339 
bearing floating interest rate. The Group's risks of changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in 
interest rates are related to fixed-rate bank borrowings (please refer to Note (V) 24 and Note (V) 34) and fixed-rate bank 
deposits. 
 
The Group determines the relative proportion of fixed interest rate contracts and floating interest rate contracts based on 
the prevailing market environment. On December 31, 2024, the Group's total long-term and short-term interest-bearing 
debts bearing fixed interest rates amounted to RMB 5,538,078,464.46 (December 31, 2023: RMB 11,105,877,902.09). 
The total amount of long-term and short-term interest-bearing debts bearing floating interest rates is RMB 
1,165,181,524.22 (December 31, 2024: RMB5,546,156,677.17). 
 
At present, the Group does not have any interest rate swap arrangements and will continue to pay close attention to the 
impact of changes in borrowing interest rates on the interest rate risk of the Group, and will make timely adjustments 
according to the latest market conditions. 
 
The Group expects that the exposure to cash flow risk arising from floating-rate bank deposits and the exposure to changes 
in fair value arising from fixed-rate bank deposits are not significant.  
 
1.1.3. Other price risks 
 
The Group's price risk mainly arises from investments in held-for-trading equity instruments and derivative financial 
instruments. Held-for-trading equity instrument investments are all investments in unlisted held-for-trading equity 
instruments. 
 
The Group is exposed to price risk due to the holding of financial assets measured at fair value. The fair value of certain 
financial instruments is determined by the general pricing model based on discounted future cash flow method or other 
valuation techniques, while the valuation techniques are based on certain valuation assumptions. Therefore, the valuation 
results are highly sensitive to valuation assumptions. However, at the end of the current reporting period, the amount of 
investment in held-for-trading equity instruments and derivative financial instruments is not significant, and the changes 
of the amount due to changes in price of financial instruments as a result of change in valuation assumptions is limited, 
accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is conducted. 
 
1.2 Credit Risk 
 
As of December 31, 2024, the largest credit risk exposure that may result in financial losses of the Group is mainly due to 
the loss of the Group's financial assets arising from the failure of the counterparty to perform its obligations, including: 
cash and bank balances (Note (V) 1), notes receivable (Note (V) 3), accounts receivable (Note (V) 4), receivables for 
financing (Note (V) 6), other receivables (Note (V) 8), contract assets (Note (V) 5 and Note (V) 22), non-current assets 
due within one year (Note (V) 10), long-term receivables (Note (V) 12), etc., and derivative financial assets that are not 
included in the scope of impairment assessment and are measured at fair value through current profit or loss (Note (V) 2). 
As of the balance sheet date, the book value of the Group's financial assets represents its maximum credit risk exposure. 
 
In order to reduce credit risk, the Group has arranged a team to determine the credit limit, conduct credit approval, and 
implement other monitoring procedures to ensure that necessary measures are taken to recover over-due debt. In addition, 
the Group reviews the recovery of financial assets on each balance sheet date to ensure that sufficient credit loss provisions 
are made for relevant financial assets. Therefore, the management of the Group believes that the credit risk exposure of 
the Group has been reduced significantly. 
 
The credit risk on cash and bank balances of the Group is low as they are deposited with banks with high credit ratings. 
 
For accounts receivable, contract assets and long-term receivables, the Group has put in place relevant policies to control 
credit risk exposure. The Group assesses credit quality of customers and sets corresponding credit period based on the 
customer's financial status, the possibility of obtaining guarantees from third parties, credit history and other factors such 
as current market conditions. The Group will regularly monitor the credit history of its customers. For customers with 
poor credit history, the Group takes various measures, such as written payment reminders, shorten or cancel the credit 
period, to ensure that the overall credit risk of the Group is maintained in a controllable range. For accounts receivable
Hikvision 2024 Annual Report        
Notes to Financial Statements 
For the reporting period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 
 
340 
and contract assets, the Group uses a simplified method, that is, to measure the loss provision based on the amount 
equivalent to the expected credit loss for the entire duration. For details of the relevant expected credit loss measurement, 
see (Note (V) 4 & Note (V) 5). For long-term receivables, the Group calculates the expected credit losses based on the 
expected credit loss rate in the next 12 months or the entire duration based on the default risk exposure. For details of the 
related expected credit loss measurement, see (Note (V) 12). 
 
For bank acceptance bills and certificates of accounts receivable claims, the Company believes that there is no significant 
credit risk and will not incur any significant losses. For financial company acceptance bills and commercial acceptance 
bills, the Company has set relevant policies to control credit risk exposure. The Company evaluates the credit status of the 
acceptor based on its financial position, credit history and other factors, such as current market conditions, and sets an 
internal credit rating for the acceptor. The Company regularly monitors the credit records of the acceptors, and for the 
acceptors with bad credit records, the Company adopts written reminders and other means to ensure that the overall credit 
risk is within a controllable range. For the acceptance bills and commercial acceptance bills receivable from financial 
companies, the Group calculates the expected credit loss based on the default risk exposure based on the expected credit 
loss ratio in the entire duration, and the relevant expected credit loss measurement is detailed in (Note (V) 3). 
 
For other receivables, the Group regularly monitors the debtor's credit history. For debtors with poor credit history, the 
Group takes various measures such as written payment reminders to ensure that the Group's overall credit risk is 
maintained in a controllable range. For other receivables, the Group calculates the expected credit loss based on the 
expected credit loss ratio in the next 12 months or the entire duration based on the default risk exposure. For details of the 
relevant expected credit loss measurement, see (Note (V) 8). 
 
The Group's risk exposure is distributed among multiple contractors and multiple customers, so the Group has no 
significant credit concentration risk. 
 
1.3. Liquidity risk 
 
The Group maintains and monitors a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate by the management to meet the 
operation needs of the Group and to reduce the effect of cash flow movements when managing liquidity risk. The 
management of the Group monitors the usage of bank borrowings, and ensures compliance with borrowing agreements. 
 
According to the term to maturity of non-discounted and remaining contract obligations, the financial liabilities held by 
the Group are analyzed as below:

and object risk characteristics of the business, and the impairment matrix is used to determine the expected credit loss of each portfolio based on the aging of accounts 
receivable over credit period. For the accounts receivable generated by the Group's subsidiaries, because the payment time is arranged by the Group according to the

The Basis for Preparing the Schedule of Non-recurring Gains and Losses: 
According to the provisions of the China Securities Regulatory Commission's ""Announcement No. 1 on the Interpretation 
of Information Disclosure for Publicly Issued Securities - Non-recurring Gains and Losses (2023 Revision),"" non-
recurring gains and losses refer to the gains and losses arising from transactions and events that are not directly related to 
the company's normal business operations, or although related to normal business operations, are of a special nature and 
occur infrequently, thereby affecting the ability of financial statement users to make correct judgments about the 
company's operating performance and profitability. 
 
2. Return on Net Assets and Earnings per Share 
 
The return on net assets and earnings per share have been prepared by Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., Ltd.

致股东 
2024 年，经营环境依然复杂多变，公司积极应对挑战，一方面挖掘国内安防市场的潜
力，更加积极开拓海外可拓展的安防市场；另一方面，持续拓展场景数字化业务，并积极
发展创新业务。2024 年，海外主业和创新业务合计收入，第一次超过国内主业收入，即PBG、
EBG、SMBG 三项业务收入之和。 
公司坚定地加大研发投入。AI 大模型技术兴起，公司积极布局AIoT 多模态大模型技
术。锁定目标市场，跟上前沿技术发展浪潮，把新技术落实到具体软硬件产品上，是公司
经营的信条。公司持续发展全电磁波、机械波的感知技术，以及多波段融合感知技术，公
司会继续丰富产品线，拓展应用场景。2018 年以来，公司研发投入保持稳定增长，以技术
创新积极应对不断恶化的全球经营环境。 
公司会顺应时代的发展。未来几年，公司从关注规模增长到关注效益的改善，力争把
现有业务做好。公司会进一步调整运营机制，优化组织架构，更好地适应外部经营环境变
化，也用数字化技术提升内外部的运营效率。 
公司依然坚持国际化。全球政治经济持续动荡，公司在一些国家持续受到严重打压，
未来也会面临一些新的挑战。经过20 多年海外市场开拓的洗礼，公司也一点点成长起来，
会继续加大海外市场营销的投入，进一步提升海外收入占比。 
无论经营环境如何变化，公司会永远以客户为中心，为客户创造价值。同时，我们也
感谢所有股东对公司的信任和支持！  
见远，行更远！

本公司提醒投资者认真阅读本报告全文，并特别注意下列风险因素： 
1) 国内经济转型风险：国内财政支出、房地产投资等相关市场持续调整，全社会对经济良好发展的
预期有待提升，部分海外国家推行贸易保护政策，对国内企业出口能力形成挑战，经济仍处于转型升级的
过程中。公司以智能物联技术和产品赋能经济、社会数字化转型，推动生产力的新发展，但转型升级难以
一蹴而就，经济与社会的结构性压力长期存在，过程中出现的起伏仍将影响公司业务开展。 
2) 全球经济下行风险：部分重要经济体增速减缓，全球各地区发展不均，宏观经济环境波动不断。
公司以广泛的业务布局分散单一区域的经营风险，根据各国各地实际状况开展业务，但如果出现全球经济
衰退，公司的业务也会受到一定的影响。 
3) 地缘政治环境风险：全球政治体系向多级化格局发展，稳定性与可预见性不断降低，局部热战持
续难解。近年来，公司持续加强风险管控，提升应对能力，根据业务环境调整资源布局，但如果地缘政治
环境突现恶化，公司在部分国家与地区的经营仍可能受到不利影响。 
4) 技术更新换代风险：人工智能、大数据、物联网、云计算等技术迅猛发展，科技应用快速迭代。
公司在物联感知、人工智能、大数据等技术领域具备一定实力，并借助广泛的商业实践保持技术迭代，但
如果不能密切追踪前沿技术的更新变化，不能保持技术体系的创新拓展，公司未来发展的不确定性风险将
会加大。 
5) 内部管理风险：公司经营规模持续扩大，新产品和新业务不断拓展，内部的管理复杂度上升，对
管理能力带来新的挑战。公司通过制度化、流程化方式沉淀管理经验，注重人才梯队培养与建设，但如果
公司管理水平跟不上业务发展，仍将给公司经营带来不利影响。 
6) 客户支付能力下降导致的资金风险：商业交易的资金流动受经济环境波动的影响，公司的资金周
转与价值链上下游伙伴的经营状况密切相关。公司回款机制健全，经营勤勉稳健，积累了一定的现金储备，
融资成本较低，但如果市场整体流动性风险增加，公司的回款速度仍可能变慢，对经营带来不利影响。 
7) 法律合规风险：世界多边贸易机制受政治冲击较大，商业活动需要遵守的各地法律法规复杂，世
界各国对数据的监管趋严，对公司的法律合规能力提出更高要求。公司在实战中建立了一整套行之有效的
法律合规管理体系，经历了国内外多重业务考验，但如果公司的法律合规能力无法跟上形势发展，仍将给
公司经营带来不利影响。 
8) 供应链风险：世界部分国家将供应链作为国际竞争的重要手段，全球供应体系近年来不断遭受地
缘政治冲击。公司努力培育多元化供应网络，合理调控库存，但如果发生供应链大范围中断的情况，仍将
影响公司的业务稳定性。 
9) 网络安全风险：公司一贯重视网络安全能力和体系建设，积极采取措施提升产品和系统安全性，
但计算机病毒、恶意软件、黑客攻击等情况仍可能发生，损害公司的系统或者产品，形成网络安全隐患。 
10) 汇率波动风险：公司在海外市场多个国家和地区开展经营，主要以外币结算。公司合理利用金融
工具对冲风险，但销售、采购以及融资产生的外币敞口客观存在，汇率波动将影响公司的财务表现。 
11) 知识产权风险：公司持续保持较大规模的研发投入，产出大量技术成果，实施了比较完善的知识
产权保护措施，但产生知识产权纠纷的风险和遭受知识产权侵害的风险仍然存在。 
上述提示未包括公司可能发生但未列示的其他风险，请投资者谨慎投资。

注册会计师姓名 
陈彦 刘颖 
 
杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司全体股东： 
 
一、审计意见 
我们审计了杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司(以下简称“海康威视”或“贵集团”)的财务报表，包括
2024 年12 月31 日的合并及母公司资产负债表、2024 年度的合并及母公司利润表、合并及母公司现金流量
表、合并及母公司股东权益变动表以及相关财务报表附注。 
我们认为，后附的财务报表在所有重大方面按照企业会计准则的规定编制，公允反映了海康威视2024
年12 月31 日的合并及母公司财务状况以及2024 年度的合并及母公司经营成果和合并及母公司现金流量。 
 
二、形成审计意见的基础 
我们按照中国注册会计师审计准则的规定执行了审计工作。审计报告的“注册会计师对财务报表审计的
责任”部分进一步阐述了我们在这些准则下的责任。按照中国注册会计师职业道德守则，我们独立于海康威
视，并履行了职业道德方面的其他责任。我们相信，我们获取的审计证据是充分、适当的，为发表审计意见
提供了基础。 
 
三、关键审计事项 
关键审计事项是我们根据职业判断，认为对本年财务报表审计最为重要的事项。这些事项的应对以对财
务报表整体进行审计并形成审计意见为背景，我们不对这些事项单独发表意见。我们确定下列事项是需要
在审计报告中沟通的关键审计事项。
杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司2024 年年度报告 
153 
(一) 销售收入确认 
事项描述 
如附注(五)、45 所示，截至2024 年12 月31 日止年度，贵集团合并财务报表中实现营业收入人民币
92,495,525,118.30 元，其中产品销售收入为人民币87,408,184,677.06 元，占营业收入94.50%，金额重大且
对经营成果有重大影响，是集团的关键业绩指标。此外，产品销售收入涉及境内公司的产品内销及出口外
销、境外子公司在境外销售等不同销售模式，收入确认较为复杂。因此，我们将产品销售收入的发生作为关
键审计事项。 
 
审计应对 
我们针对上述关键审计事项所执行的主要审计程序包括： 
(1) 了解和评价与收入确认相关的关键内部控制的设计和执行，并测试其运行的有效性； 
(2) 针对不同销售模式下的收入，选取样本检查销售合同，查看其主要交易条款，评价收入确认是否
符合集团的会计政策和企业会计准则的要求；  
(3) 结合产品类型对收入及毛利情况进行分析，了解本年度收入及毛利是否存在异常波动的情况，并
通过收入数据的系统分析识别出的特定交易对其执行细节测试，检查相关的支持性文件； 
(4) 从本年记录的产品销售收入交易中选取样本，检查发票、销售合同或订单、发运单、签收单等支
持性文件，对于选取的境内公司的出口外销模式下收入样本追加检查至海关报关记录和装运记录。 
 
 (二) 应收账款的信用损失准备 
事项描述 
如附注(五)、4 所示，截至2024 年12 月31 日止，贵集团合并财务报表中应收账款余额为人民币
41,824,083,460.37 元，应收账款的信用损失准备余额为人民币3,913,954,724.95 元。贵集团应收账款账面价
值较高，应收账款信用损失准备的计提对财务报表影响较为重大。如财务报表附注(三)、11.2、附注(三)、13
及附注(三)、35 所示，贵集团对于应收账款按照相当于整个存续期内预期信用损失的金额计提信用损失准
备。贵集团对单项金额重大且债务人发生重大财务困难等情况的应收账款，在单项资产的基础上确定其信
用损失；对于其他的应收账款以共同信用风险特征为依据划分为不同组合，在组合基础上计算预期信用损
失。 
对于划分为组合的应收账款，贵集团采用减值矩阵确定应收账款的预期信用损失准备。各组合的预期信
用损失计提比例是基于贵集团历史逾期比例和违约情况，并考虑行业前瞻性信息确定的。上述会计估计涉
及高度不确定性，因此，我们将组合确认的应收账款信用损失准备作为关键审计事项。
杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司2024 年年度报告 
154 
 
审计应对 
我们针对上述关键审计事项所执行的主要审计程序包括： 
(1) 了解和评价贵集团与计提应收账款预期信用损失准备相关的关键内部控制的设计和执行，并测试
其运行的有效性； 
(2) 了解贵集团的应收账款预期信用损失的会计政策；并对组合确认的应收账款信用损失准备的模型
执行了以下主要程序： 
- 
评估减值矩阵模型计量方法的合理性，以及减值矩阵模型的关键参数和假设的合理性，包括不同
组合的划分，阶段划分，前瞻性调整等； 
- 
获取贵集团管理层确认应收账款历史损失率所使用的历史违约数据，评价其准确性； 
- 
选取样本测试贵集团管理层对组合划分和阶段划分的准确性； 
- 
按照违约损失百分比，重新计算预期信用损失准备。 
  
四、其他信息 
海康威视管理层对其他信息负责。其他信息包括年度报告中涵盖的信息，但不包括财务报表和我们的审
计报告。 
我们对财务报表发表的审计意见不涵盖其他信息，我们也不对其他信息发表任何形式的鉴证结论。 
结合我们对财务报表的审计，我们的责任是阅读其他信息，在此过程中，考虑其他信息是否与财务报表
或我们在审计过程中了解到的情况存在重大不一致或者似乎存在重大错报。 
基于我们已执行的工作，如果我们确定其他信息存在重大错报，我们应当报告该事实。在这方面，我们
无任何事项需要报告。 
 
五、管理层和治理层对财务报表的责任 
海康威视管理层负责按照企业会计准则的规定编制财务报表，使其实现公允反映，并设计、执行和维护
必要的内部控制，以使财务报表不存在由于舞弊或错误导致的重大错报。 
在编制财务报表时，管理层负责评估海康威视的持续经营能力，披露与持续经营相关的事项（如适用），
并运用持续经营假设，除非管理层计划清算海康威视、终止运营或别无其他现实的选择。 
治理层负责监督海康威视的财务报告过程。
杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司2024 年年度报告 
155 
六、注册会计师对财务报表审计的责任 
我们的目标是对财务报表整体是否不存在由于舞弊或错误导致的重大错报获取合理保证，并出具包含
审计意见的审计报告。合理保证是高水平的保证，但并不能保证按照审计准则执行的审计在某一重大错报
存在时总能发现。错报可能由于舞弊或错误导致，如果合理预期错报单独或汇总起来可能影响财务报表使
用者依据财务报表作出的经济决策，则通常认为错报是重大的。 
在按照审计准则执行审计工作的过程中，我们运用职业判断，并保持职业怀疑。同时，我们也执行以下
工作： 
(1) 识别和评估由于舞弊或错误导致的财务报表重大错报风险，设计和实施审计程序以应对这些风
险，并获取充分、适当的审计证据，作为发表审计意见的基础。由于舞弊可能涉及串通、伪造、故意遗
漏、虚假陈述或凌驾于内部控制之上，未能发现由于舞弊导致的重大错报的风险高于未能发现由于错误导
致的重大错报的风险。 
(2) 了解与审计相关的内部控制，以设计恰当的审计程序。 
(3) 评价管理层选用会计政策的恰当性和作出会计估计及相关披露的合理性。 
(4) 对管理层使用持续经营假设的恰当性得出结论。同时，根据获取的审计证据，就可能导致对海康
威视持续经营能力产生重大疑虑的事项或情况是否存在重大不确定性得出结论。如果我们得出结论认为存
在重大不确定性，审计准则要求我们在审计报告中提请报表使用者注意财务报表中的相关披露；如果披露
不充分，我们应当发表非无保留意见。我们的结论基于截至审计报告日可获得的信息。然而，未来的事项
或情况可能导致海康威视不能持续经营。 
(5) 评价财务报表的总体列报(包括披露)、结构和内容，并评价财务报表是否公允反映相关交易和事
项。 
(6) 就海康威视中实体或业务活动的财务信息获取充分、适当的审计证据，以对财务报表发表审计意
见。我们负责指导、监督和执行集团审计，并对审计意见承担全部责任。 
我们与治理层就计划的审计范围、时间安排和重大审计发现等事项进行沟通，包括沟通我们在审计中识
别出的值得关注的内部控制缺陷。 
我们还就已遵守与独立性相关的职业道德要求向治理层提供声明，并与治理层沟通可能被合理认为影
响我们独立性的所有关系和其他事项，以及相关的防范措施（如适用）。 
从与治理层沟通过的事项中，我们确定哪些事项对本期财务报表审计最为重要，因而构成关键审计事
项。我们在审计报告中描述这些事项，除非法律法规禁止公开披露这些事项，或在极少数情形下，如果合理
预期在审计报告中沟通某事项造成的负面后果超过在公众利益方面产生的益处，我们确定不应在审计报告
中沟通该事项。

(一) 
公司基本情况 
 
1. 
公司概况 
 
杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司（以下简称“公司”或“本公司”或“海康威视”）前身为杭州海
康威视数字技术有限公司，杭州海康威视数字技术有限公司系经杭州市高新技术产业开发区管理委员会
杭高新〔2001〕604号文批准设立的中外合资经营企业，于2001年11月30日在杭州市工商行政管理局登记
注册。经商务部商资批〔2008〕598号文批准，杭州海康威视数字技术有限公司整体变更为本公司，并于
2008年6月25日在浙江省工商行政管理局办妥变更登记。总部位于浙江省杭州市。公司股票于2010年5月
28日在深圳证券交易所挂牌交易。 
 
本公司及其子公司(以下简称“本集团”)主要经营活动包括制造和销售安防设备、网络设备、智能设备；
制造和批发汽车零部件及配件；销售电子产品；提供建设工程施工；技术服务、技术开发、技术咨询、
软件开发、信息系统集成服务、数据处理和存储支持服务等。 
 
2. 
财务报表批准报出日 
 
本公司的公司及合并财务报表于2025年4月17日已经第六届董事会第五次会议批准对外报出。 
 
 
(二) 
财务报表的编制基础 
 
编制基础 
 
本集团执行财政部颁布的企业会计准则及相关规定。此外，本集团还按照《公开发行证券的公司信息披
露编报规则第15号—财务报告的一般规定(2023年修订)》披露有关财务信息。 
 
持续经营 
 
本集团对自2024年12月31日起12个月的持续经营能力进行了评价，未发现对持续经营能力产生重大怀疑
的事项和情况。因此，本财务报表系在持续经营假设的基础上编制。 
 
记账基础和计价原则 
 
本集团会计核算以权责发生制为记账基础。除某些金融工具以公允价值计量外，本财务报表以历史成本
作为计量基础。资产如果发生减值，则按照相关规定计提相应的减值准备。 
 
在历史成本计量下，资产按照购置时支付的现金或者现金等价物的金额或者所付出的对价的公允价值计
量。负债按照因承担现时义务而实际收到的款项或者资产的金额，或者承担现时义务的合同金额，或者
按照日常活动中为偿还负债预期需要支付的现金或者现金等价物的金额计量。 
 
公允价值是市场参与者在计量日发生的有序交易中，出售一项资产所能收到或者转移一项负债所需支付
的价格。无论公允价值是可观察到的还是采用估值技术估计的，在本财务报表中计量和披露的公允价值
均在此基础上予以确定。 
 
以公允价值计量非金融资产时，考虑市场参与者将该资产用于最佳用途产生经济利益的能力，或者将该
资产出售给能够用于最佳用途的其他市场参与者产生经济利益的能力。 
 
对于以交易价格作为初始确认时的公允价值，且在公允价值后续计量中使用了涉及不可观察输入值的估
值技术的金融资产，在估值过程中校正该估值技术，以使估值技术确定的初始确认结果与交易价格相等。

(二)   财务报表的编制基础 - 续 
 
记账基础和计价原则 - 续 
 
公允价值计量基于公允价值的输入值的可观察程度以及该等输入值对公允价值计量整体的重要性，被划
分为三个层次： 
 
 
第一层次输入值是在计量日能够取得的相同资产或负债在活跃市场上未经调整的报价。 
 
第二层次输入值是除第一层次输入值外相关资产或负债直接或间接可观察的输入值。 
 
第三层次输入值是相关资产或负债的不可观察输入值。 
 
 
(三)   重要会计政策及会计估计 
 
具体会计政策和会计估计提示： 
 
本集团根据实际生产经营特点针对重要性标准确定方法和选择依据、应收账款信用损失准备、存货跌价
准备、固定资产折旧、收入确认，制定了具体会计政策和会计估计。本集团在确认重要的会计政策时所
运用的重要判断和会计估计及其关键假设，详见附注(三)、35。

6. 
同一控制和非同一控制下企业合并的会计处理方法 
 
企业合并分为同一控制下的企业合并和非同一控制下的企业合并。 
 
6.1 
同一控制下的企业合并 
 
参与合并的企业在合并前后均受同一方或相同的多方最终控制，且该控制并非暂时性的，为同一控制下
的企业合并。 
 
在企业合并中取得的资产和负债，按合并日其在被合并方的账面价值计量。合并方取得的净资产账面价
值与支付的合并对价的账面价值的差额，调整资本公积中的股本溢价，股本溢价不足冲减的则调整留存
收益。 
 
为进行企业合并发生的各项直接费用，于发生时计入当期损益。 
 
6.2 
非同一控制下的企业合并及商誉 
 
参与合并的企业在合并前后不受同一方或相同的多方最终控制，为非同一控制下的企业合并。 
 
合并成本指购买方为取得被购买方的控制权而付出的资产、发生或承担的负债和发行的权益性工具的公
允价值。通过多次交易分步实现非同一控制下的企业合并的，合并成本为购买日支付的对价与购买日之
前已经持有的被购买方的股权在购买日的公允价值之和。购买方为企业合并而发生的审计、法律服务、
评估咨询等中介费用以及其他相关管理费用，于发生时计入当期损益。 
 
购买方在合并中所取得的被购买方符合确认条件的可辨认资产、负债及或有负债在收购日以公允价值计
量。 
 
合并成本大于合并中取得的被购买方可辨认净资产公允价值份额的差额，作为一项资产确认为商誉并按
成本进行初始计量。合并成本小于合并中取得的被购买方可辨认净资产公允价值份额的，首先对取得的
被购买方各项可辨认资产、负债及或有负债的公允价值以及合并成本的计量进行复核，复核后合并成本
仍小于合并中取得的被购买方可辨认净资产公允价值份额的，计入当期损益。 
 
因企业合并形成的商誉在合并财务报表中单独列报，并按照成本扣除累计减值准备后的金额计量。

(三)    重要会计政策及会计估计 - 续 
 
7. 
控制的判断标准和合并财务报表的编制方法 
 
7.1 
控制的判断标准 
 
控制是指投资方拥有对被投资方的权力，通过参与被投资方的相关活动而享有可变回报，并且有能力运
用对被投资方的权力影响其回报金额。一旦相关事实和情况的变化导致上述控制定义涉及的相关要素发
生了变化，本集团将进行重新评估。 
 
7.2 
合并财务报表的编制方法 
 
合并财务报表的合并范围以控制为基础予以确定。 
 
子公司的合并起始于本集团获得对该子公司的控制权时，终止于本集团丧失对该子公司的控制权时。 
 
对于本集团处置的子公司，处置日(丧失控制权的日期)前的经营成果和现金流量已经适当地包括在合并
利润表和合并现金流量表中。 
 
对于通过非同一控制下的企业合并取得的子公司，其自购买日(取得控制权的日期)起的经营成果及现金
流量已经适当地包括在合并利润表和合并现金流量表中。 
 
对于通过同一控制下的企业合并取得的子公司，无论该项企业合并发生在报告期的任一时点，视同该子
公司同受最终控制方控制之日起纳入本集团的合并范围，其自报告期最早期间期初起的经营成果和现金
流量已适当地包括在合并利润表和合并现金流量表中。 
 
子公司采用的主要会计政策和会计期间按照本公司统一规定的会计政策和会计期间厘定。 
 
本公司与子公司及子公司相互之间发生的内部交易对合并财务报表的影响于合并时抵销。 
 
子公司所有者权益中不属于母公司的份额作为少数股东权益，在合并资产负债表中股东权益项目下以“少
数股东权益”项目列示。子公司当期净损益中属于少数股东权益的份额，在合并利润表中净利润项目下以
“少数股东损益”项目列示。 
 
少数股东分担的子公司的亏损超过了少数股东在该子公司期初所有者权益中所享有的份额，其余额仍冲
减少数股东权益。 
 
对于购买子公司少数股权或因处置部分股权投资但没有丧失对该子公司控制权的交易，作为权益性交易
核算，调整归属于母公司所有者权益和少数股东权益的账面价值以反映其在子公司中相关权益的变化。
少数股东权益的调整额与支付/收到对价的公允价值之间的差额调整资本公积，资本公积不足冲减的，调
整留存收益。 
 
通过多次交易分步取得被购买方的股权，最终形成非同一控制下的企业合并的，分别是否属于“一揽子交
易”进行处理：属于“一揽子交易”的，将各项交易作为一项取得控制权的交易进行会计处理。不属于“一
揽子交易”的，在购买日作为取得控制权的交易进行会计处理，购买日之前持有的被购买方的股权按该股
权在购买日的公允价值进行重新计量，公允价值与账面价值之间的差额计入当期损益；购买日前持有的
被购买方的股权涉及权益法核算下的其他综合收益、其他所有者权益变动的，转为购买日所属当期收益。

(三)    重要会计政策及会计估计 - 续 
 
8. 
合营安排分类及会计处理方法 
 
合营安排分为共同经营和合营企业，该分类通过考虑该安排的结构、法律形式以及合同条款等因素根据
合营方在合营安排中享有的权利和承担的义务确定。 
 
本集团对合营企业的投资采用权益法核算，具体参见附注(三)“18.3.2. 按权益法核算的长期股权投资”。 
 
9. 
现金及现金等价物的确定标准 
 
现金是指库存现金以及可以随时用于支付的存款。现金等价物是指本集团持有的期限短(一般指从购买日
起三个月内到期)、流动性强、易于转换为已知金额现金、价值变动风险很小的投资。 
 
10. 
外币业务和外币报表折算 
 
10.1  
外币业务 
 
外币交易在初始确认时采用与交易发生日即期汇率近似的汇率折算，与交易发生日即期汇率近似的汇率
按交易发生当月月初的市场汇价中间价计算确定。 
 
于资产负债表日，外币货币性项目采用该日即期汇率折算为人民币，因该日的即期汇率与初始确认时或
者前一资产负债表日即期汇率不同而产生的汇兑差额，除符合资本化条件的外币专门借款的汇兑差额在
资本化期间予以资本化计入相关资产的成本外，均计入当期损益。 
 
编制合并财务报表涉及境外经营的，如有实质上构成对境外经营净投资的外币货币性项目，因汇率变动
而产生的汇兑差额，列入其他综合收益的“外币报表折算差额”项目；处置境外经营时，计入处置当期损
益。 
 
以历史成本计量的外币非货币性项目仍以交易发生日的即期汇率折算的记账本位币金额计量。 
 
10.2  
外币财务报表折算 
 
为编制合并财务报表，境外经营的外币财务报表按以下方法折算为人民币报表：资产负债表中的所有资

金融工具 
 
本集团在成为金融工具合同的一方时确认一项金融资产或金融负债。 
 
对于以常规方式购买或出售金融资产的，在交易日确认将收到的资产和为此将承担的负债，或者在交易
日终止确认已出售的资产。 
 
金融资产和金融负债在初始确认时以公允价值计量(金融资产和金融负债的公允价值的确定方法参见附
注(二)中记账基础和计价原则的相关披露)。对于以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产和金
融负债，相关的交易费用直接计入当期损益；对于其他类别的金融资产和金融负债，相关交易费用计入
初始确认金额。当本集团按照《企业会计准则第14 号——收入》(“收入准则”)初始确认未包含重大融资
成分或不考虑不超过一年的合同中的融资成分的应收账款时，按照收入准则定义的交易价格进行初始计
量。 
 
实际利率法是指计算金融资产或金融负债的摊余成本以及将利息收入或利息费用分摊计入各会计期间的
方法。 
 
实际利率，是指将金融资产或金融负债在预计存续期的估计未来现金流量，折现为该金融资产账面余额
或该金融负债摊余成本所使用的利率。在确定实际利率时，在考虑金融资产或金融负债所有合同条款(如
提前还款、展期、看涨期权或其他类似期权等)的基础上估计预期现金流量，但不考虑预期信用损失。 
 
金融资产或金融负债的摊余成本是以该金融资产或金融负债的初始确认金额扣除已偿还的本金，加上或
减去采用实际利率法将该初始确认金额与到期日金额之间的差额进行摊销形成的累计摊销额，再扣除累
计计提的损失准备(仅适用于金融资产)。 
 
11.1 
金融资产的分类、确认与计量 
 
初始确认后，本集团对不同类别的金融资产，分别以摊余成本、以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合
收益或以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益进行后续计量。 
 
金融资产的合同条款规定在特定日期产生的现金流量仅为对本金和以未偿付本金金额为基础的利息的支
付，且本集团管理该金融资产的业务模式是以收取合同现金流量为目标，则本集团将该金融资产分类为
以摊余成本计量的金融资产。本集团分类为以摊余成本计量的金融资产包括货币资金、应收票据、应收
账款、其他应收款、长期应收款和其他非流动资产等。 
 
金融资产的合同条款规定在特定日期产生的现金流量仅为对本金和以未偿付本金金额为基础的利息的支
付，且本集团管理该金融资产的业务模式既以收取合同现金流量为目标又以出售该金融资产为目标的，
则该金融资产分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的金融资产。此类金融资产自取得起期
限在一年以上的，列示为其他债权投资，自资产负债表日起一年内(含一年)到期的，列示于一年内到期的
非流动资产；取得时分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的应收票据，列示于应收款项融
资，其余取得时期限在一年内(含一年)项目列示于其他流动资产。 
 
初始确认时，本集团可以单项金融资产为基础，不可撤销地将非同一控制下的企业合并中确认的或有对
价以外的非交易性权益工具投资指定为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的金融资产。此类金
融资产作为其他权益工具投资列示。

金融资产的分类、确认与计量 - 续 
 
金融资产满足下列条件之一的，表明本集团持有该金融资产的目的是交易性的： 
 
 
取得相关金融资产的目的，主要是为了近期出售。 
 
相关金融资产在初始确认时属于集中管理的可辨认金融工具组合的一部分，且有客观证据表明
近期实际存在短期获利模式。 
 
相关金融资产属于衍生工具。 
 
以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产包括分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的
金融资产和指定为以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产： 
 
 
不符合分类为以摊余成本计量的金融资产、以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的金融
资产条件的金融资产均分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产。 
 
在初始确认时，为消除或显著减少会计错配，本集团可以将金融资产不可撤销地指定为以公允
价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产。 
 
除衍生金融资产外的以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产列示于交易性金融资产。自资产
负债表日起超过一年到期(或无固定期限)且预期持有超过一年的，列示于其他非流动金融资产。 
 
11.1.1 以摊余成本计量的金融资产 
 
以摊余成本计量的金融资产采用实际利率法，按摊余成本进行后续计量，发生减值时或终止确认产生的
利得或损失，计入当期损益。 
 
本集团对以摊余成本计量的金融资产按照实际利率法确认利息收入。除下列情况外，本集团根据金融资
产账面余额乘以实际利率计算确定利息收入：  
 
 
对于购入或源生的已发生信用减值的金融资产，本集团自初始确认起，按照该金融资产的摊余
成本和经信用调整的实际利率计算确定其利息收入。 
 
对于购入或源生的未发生信用减值、但在后续期间成为已发生信用减值的金融资产，本集团在
后续期间，按照该金融资产的摊余成本和实际利率计算确定其利息收入。若该金融工具在后续
期间因其信用风险有所改善而不再存在信用减值，本集团转按实际利率乘以该金融资产账面余
额来计算确定利息收入。 
 
11.1.2 以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的金融资产 
 
分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的金融资产相关的减值损失或利得、采用实际利率法
计算的利息收入计入当期损益，除此以外该金融资产的公允价值变动均计入其他综合收益。该金融资产
计入各期损益的金额与视同其一直按摊余成本计量而计入各期损益的金额相等。该金融资产终止确认时，
之前计入其他综合收益的累计利得或损失从其他综合收益中转出，计入当期损益。 
 
指定为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的非交易性权益工具投资的公允价值变动在其他综合
收益中进行确认，该金融资产终止确认时，之前计入其他综合收益的累计利得或损失从其他综合收益中
转出，计入留存收益。本集团持有该等非交易性权益工具投资期间，在本集团收取股利的权利已经确立，
与股利相关的经济利益很可能流入本集团，且股利的金额能够可靠计量时，确认股利收入并计入当期损
益。

金融工具减值 
 
本集团对以摊余成本计量的金融资产、分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的金融资产、
租赁应收款以及合同资产以预期信用损失为基础进行减值会计处理并确认损失准备。 
 
本集团对由收入准则规范的交易形成且未包含重大融资成分或不考虑不超过一年的合同中的融资成分的
合同资产、应收票据及应收账款，以及由《企业会计准则第21号——租赁》规范的交易形成的应收租赁
款，按照相当于整个存续期内预期信用损失的金额计量损失准备。 
 
对于其他金融工具，除购买或源生的已发生信用减值的金融资产外，本集团在每个资产负债表日评估相
关金融工具的信用风险自初始确认后的变动情况。若该金融工具的信用风险自初始确认后已显著增加，
本集团按照相当于该金融工具整个存续期内预期信用损失的金额计量其损失准备；若该金融工具的信用
风险自初始确认后并未显著增加，本集团按照相当于该金融工具未来12个月内预期信用损失的金额计量
其损失准备。信用损失准备的增加或转回金额，除分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的
金融资产外，作为减值损失或利得计入当期损益。对于分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收
益的金融资产，本集团在其他综合收益中确认其信用损失准备，并将减值损失或利得计入当期损益，且
不减少该金融资产在资产负债表中列示的账面价值。 
 
本集团在前一会计期间已经按照相当于金融工具整个存续期内预期信用损失的金额计量了损失准备，但
在当期资产负债表日，该金融工具已不再属于自初始确认后信用风险显著增加的情形的，本集团在当期
资产负债表日按照相当于未来12 个月内预期信用损失的金额计量该金融工具的损失准备，由此形成的
损失准备的转回金额作为减值利得计入当期损益。 
 
11.2.1 信用风险显著增加 
 
本集团利用可获得的合理且有依据的前瞻性信息，通过比较金融工具在资产负债表日发生违约的风险与
在初始确认日发生违约的风险，以确定金融工具的信用风险自初始确认后是否已显著增加。 
 
本集团在评估信用风险是否显著增加时会考虑如下因素： 
 
(1) 
信用风险变化所导致的内部价格指标是否发生显著变化； 
(2) 
金融工具外部信用评级实际或预期是否发生显著变化； 
(3) 
对债务人实际或预期的内部信用评级是否下调； 
(4) 
预期将导致债务人履行其偿债义务的能力发生显著变化的业务、财务或经济状况是否发生不利变
化； 
(5) 
债务人经营成果实际或预期是否发生显著变化； 
(6) 
债务人所处的监管、经济或技术环境是否发生显著不利变化； 
(7) 
作为债务抵押的担保物价值或第三方提供的担保或信用增级质量是否发生显著变化。这些变化预
期将降低债务人按合同规定期限还款的经济动机或者影响违约概率； 
(8) 
预期将降低借款人按合同约定期限还款的经济动机是否发生显著变化； 
(9) 
债务人预期表现和还款行为是否发生显著变化。

11.2.1 信用风险显著增加 - 续 
 
无论经上述评估后信用风险是否显著增加，当金融工具合同付款已发生逾期超过(含)30 天的，则表明该
金融工具的信用风险已经显著增加。 
 
于资产负债表日，若本集团判断金融工具只具有较低的信用风险，则本集团假定该金融工具的信用风险
自初始确认后并未显著增加。如果金融工具的违约风险较低，借款人在短期内履行其合同现金流量义务
的能力很强，并且即使较长时期内经济形势和经营环境存在不利变化但未必一定降低借款人履行其合同
现金义务，则该金融工具被视为具有较低的信用风险。 
 
11.2.2 已发生信用减值的金融资产 
 
当本集团预期对金融资产未来现金流量具有不利影响的一项或多项事件发生时，该金融资产成为已发生
信用减值的金融资产。金融资产已发生信用减值的证据包括下列可观察信息： 
 
(1) 
发行方或债务人发生重大财务困难； 
(2) 
债务人违反合同，如偿付利息或本金违约或逾期等； 
(3) 
债权人出于与债务人财务困难有关的经济或合同考虑，给予债务人在任何其他情况下都不会做出
的让步； 
(4) 
债务人很可能破产或进行其他财务重组； 
(5) 
发行方或债务人财务困难导致该金融资产的活跃市场消失； 
(6) 
以大幅折扣购买或源生一项金融资产，该折扣反映了发生信用损失的事实。 
 
11.2.3 预期信用损失的确定 
 
本集团按照下列方法确定相关金融工具的预期信用损失： 
 
 
对于金融资产和租赁应收款，信用损失为本集团应收取的合同现金流量与预期收取的现金流量
之间差额的现值。 
 
对于资产负债表日已发生信用减值但并非购买或源生已发生信用减值的金融资产，信用损失为
该金融资产账面余额与按原实际利率折现的估计未来现金流量的现值之间的差额。 
 
本集团计量金融工具预期信用损失的方法反映的因素包括：通过评价一系列可能的结果而确定的无偏概
率加权平均金额；货币时间价值；在资产负债表日无须付出不必要的额外成本或努力即可获得的有关过
去事项、当前状况以及未来经济状况预测的合理且有依据的信息。 
 
11.2.4 减记金融资产 
 
当本集团不再合理预期金融资产合同现金流量能够全部或部分收回的，直接减记该金融资产的账面余额。
这种减记构成相关金融资产的终止确认。

金融资产的转移 
 
满足下列条件之一的金融资产，予以终止确认：(1)收取该金融资产现金流量的合同权利终止；(2)该金融
资产已转移，且将金融资产所有权上几乎所有的风险和报酬转移给转入方；(3)该金融资产已转移，虽然
本集团既没有转移也没有保留金融资产所有权上几乎所有的风险和报酬，但是未保留对该金融资产的控
制。 
 
若本集团既没有转移也没有保留金融资产所有权上几乎所有风险和报酬，且保留了对该金融资产控制的，
则按照其继续涉入被转移金融资产的程度继续确认该被转移金融资产，并相应确认相关负债。本集团按
照下列方式对相关负债进行计量： 
 
 
被转移金融资产以摊余成本计量的，相关负债的账面价值等于继续涉入被转移金融资产的账面
价值减去本集团保留的权利(如果本集团因金融资产转移保留了相关权利)的摊余成本并加上本
集团承担的义务(如果本集团因金融资产转移承担了相关义务)的摊余成本，相关负债不指定为
以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融负债。 
 
被转移金融资产以公允价值计量的，相关负债的账面价值等于继续涉入被转移金融资产的账面
价值减去本集团保留的权利(如果本集团因金融资产转移保留了相关权利)的公允价值并加上本
集团承担的义务(如果本集团因金融资产转移承担了相关义务)的公允价值，该权利和义务的公
允价值应为按独立基础计量时的公允价值。 
 
金融资产整体转移满足终止确认条件的，将所转移金融资产在终止确认日的账面价值及因转移金融资产
而收到的对价与原计入其他综合收益的公允价值变动累计额中对应终止确认部分的金额之和的差额计入
当期损益。若本集团转移的金融资产是指定为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的非交易性权
益工具投资，之前计入其他综合收益的累计利得或损失从其他综合收益中转出，计入留存收益。 
 
金融资产部分转移满足终止确认条件的，将转移前金融资产整体的账面价值在终止确认部分和继续确认
部分之间按照转移日各自的相对公允价值进行分摊，并将终止确认部分收到的对价和原计入其他综合收
益的公允价值变动累计额中对应终止确认部分的金额之和与终止确认部分在终止确认日的账面价值之差
额计入当期损益。若本集团转移的金融资产是指定为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的非交
易性权益工具投资，之前计入其他综合收益的累计利得或损失从其他综合收益中转出，计入留存收益。 
 
金融资产整体转移未满足终止确认条件的，本集团继续确认所转移的金融资产整体，因资产转移而收到
的对价在收到时确认为负债。 
 
11.4 
金融负债和权益工具的分类、确认及计量 
 
本集团根据所发行金融工具的合同条款及其所反映的经济实质而非仅以法律形式，结合金融负债和权益

计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融负债列示为交易性金融负债。 
 
金融负债满足下列条件之一，表明本集团承担该金融负债的目的是交易性的： 
 
 
承担相关金融负债的目的，主要是为了近期回购； 
 
相关金融负债在初始确认时属于集中管理的可辨认金融工具组合的一部分，且有客观证据表明
近期实际存在短期获利模式； 
 
相关金融负债属于衍生工具。 
 
本集团将符合下列条件之一的金融负债，在初始确认时可以指定为以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损
益的金融负债：(1)该指定能够消除或显著减少会计错配；(2)根据本集团正式书面文件载明的风险管理或
投资策略，以公允价值为基础对金融负债组合或金融资产和金融负债组合进行管理和业绩评价，并在本
集团内部以此为基础向关键管理人员报告；(3)符合条件的包含嵌入衍生工具的混合合同。 
 
交易性金融负债采用公允价值进行后续计量，公允价值变动形成的利得或损失以及与该等金融负债相关
的股利或利息支出计入当期损益。 
 
11.4.1.2 其他金融负债 
 
除金融资产转移不符合终止确认条件或继续涉入被转移金融资产所形成的金融负债外的其他金融负债分
类为以摊余成本计量的金融负债，按摊余成本进行后续计量，终止确认或摊销产生的利得或损失计入当
期损益。 
 
本集团与交易对手方修改或重新议定合同，未导致按摊余成本进行后续计量的金融负债终止确认，但导
致合同现金流量发生变化的，本集团重新计算该金融负债的账面价值，并将相关利得或损失计入当期损
益。重新计算的该金融负债的账面价值，本集团根据将重新议定或修改的合同现金流量按金融负债的原
实际利率折现的现值确定。对于修改或重新议定合同所产生的所有成本或费用，本集团调整修改后的金
融负债的账面价值，并在修改后金融负债的剩余期限内进行摊销。 
 
11.4.2 金融负债的终止确认 
 
金融负债的现时义务全部或部分已经解除的，终止确认该金融负债或其一部分。本集团(借入方)与借出
方之间签订协议，以承担新金融负债方式替换原金融负债，且新金融负债与原金融负债的合同条款实质
上不同的，本集团终止确认原金融负债，并同时确认新金融负债。  
 
金融负债全部或部分终止确认的，将终止确认部分的账面价值与支付的对价(包括转出的非现金资产或承
担的新金融负债)之间的差额，计入当期损益。

16.1.2 发出存货的计价方法 
 
存货发出时，采用移动加权平均法确定发出存货的实际成本。 
 
16.1.3 存货的盘存制度 
 
存货盘存制度为永续盘存制。 
 
16.1.4 低值易耗品和包装物的摊销方法 
 
包装物和低值易耗品采用一次转销法进行摊销。 
 
16.2 存货跌价准备的确认标准和计提方法 
 
资产负债表日，存货按照成本与可变现净值孰低计量。当其可变现净值低于成本时，提取存货跌价准备。 
 
可变现净值是指在日常活动中，存货的估计售价减去至完工时估计将要发生的成本、估计的销售费用以
及相关税费后的金额。在确定存货的可变现净值时，以取得的确凿证据为基础，同时考虑持有存货的目
的以及资产负债表日后事项的影响。 
 
计提存货跌价准备后，如果以前减记存货价值的影响因素已经消失，导致存货的可变现净值高于其账面
价值的，在原已计提的存货跌价准备金额内予以转回，转回的金额计入当期损益。 
 
16.3 按照组合计提存货跌价准备的组合类别及确定依据、不同类别存货可变现净值的确定依据 
 
本集团对于数量繁多、单价较低的存货，按存货类别计提存货跌价准备；对与在同一地区生产和销售的
产品系列相关、具有相同或类似最终用途或目的，且难以与其他项目分开计量的存货，合并计提存货跌
价准备；本集团根据存货性质和状态分组计提存货跌价准备。

长期股权投资 
 
18.1  
共同控制、重要影响的判断标准 
 
控制是指投资方拥有对被投资方的权力，通过参与被投资方的相关活动而享有可变回报，并且有能力运
用对被投资方的权力影响其回报金额。共同控制是指按照相关约定对某项安排所共有的控制，并且该安
排的相关活动必须经过分享控制权的参与方一致同意后才能决策。重大影响是指对被投资方的财务和经
营政策有参与决策的权力，但并不能够控制或者与其他方一起共同控制这些政策的制定。在确定能否对
被投资单位实施控制或施加重大影响时，已考虑投资方和其他方持有的被投资单位当期可转换公司债券、
当期可执行认股权证等潜在表决权因素。 
 
18.2  
初始投资成本的确定 
 
对于同一控制下的企业合并取得的长期股权投资，在合并日按照被合并方所有者权益在最终控制方合并
财务报表中的账面价值的份额作为长期股权投资的初始投资成本。长期股权投资初始投资成本与支付的
现金、转让的非现金资产以及所承担债务账面价值之间的差额，调整资本公积；资本公积不足冲减的，
调整留存收益。以发行权益性证券作为合并对价的，在合并日按照被合并方所有者权益在最终控制方合
并财务报表中的账面价值的份额作为长期股权投资的初始投资成本，按照发行股份的面值总额作为股本，
长期股权投资初始投资成本与所发行股份面值总额之间的差额，调整资本公积；资本公积不足冲减的，
调整留存收益。 
 
对于非同一控制下的企业合并取得的长期股权投资，在购买日按照合并成本作为长期股权投资的初始投
资成本。通过多次交易分步取得被购买方的股权，最终形成非同一控制下的企业合并的，分别是否属于
“一揽子交易”进行处理：属于“一揽子交易”的，将各项交易作为一项取得控制权的交易进行会计处理。
不属于“一揽子交易”的，按照原持有被购买方的股权投资账面价值加上新增投资成本之和，作为改按成
本法核算的长期股权投资的初始投资成本。原持有的股权采用权益法核算的，相关其他综合收益暂不进
行会计处理。 
 
合并方或购买方为企业合并发生的审计、法律服务、评估咨询等中介费用以及其他相关管理费用，于发
生时计入当期损益。 
 
除企业合并形成的长期股权投资外其他方式取得的长期股权投资，按成本进行初始计量。 
 
18.3  
后续计量及损益确认方法 
 
18.3.1  按成本法核算的长期股权投资 
 
公司财务报表采用成本法核算对子公司的长期股权投资。子公司是指本集团能够对其实施控制的被投资
主体。 
 
采用成本法核算的长期股权投资按初始投资成本计量。追加或收回投资调整长期股权投资的成本。当期
投资收益按照享有被投资单位宣告发放的现金股利或利润确认。

18.3.2  按权益法核算的长期股权投资 
 
除全部或部分分类为持有待售资产的对联营企业和合营企业的投资外，本集团对联营企业和合营企业的
投资采用权益法核算。联营企业是指本集团能够对其施加重大影响的被投资单位，合营企业是指本集团
仅对该安排的净资产享有权利的合营安排。 
 
采用权益法核算时，长期股权投资的初始投资成本大于投资时应享有被投资单位可辨认净资产公允价值
份额的，不调整长期股权投资的初始投资成本；初始投资成本小于投资时应享有被投资单位可辨认净资
产公允价值份额的，其差额计入当期损益，同时调整长期股权投资的成本。 
 
采用权益法核算时，按照应享有或应分担的被投资单位实现的净损益和其他综合收益的份额，分别确认
投资收益和其他综合收益，同时调整长期股权投资的账面价值；按照被投资单位宣告分派的利润或现金
股利计算应享有的部分，相应减少长期股权投资的账面价值；对于被投资单位除净损益、其他综合收益
和利润分配以外所有者权益的其他变动，调整长期股权投资的账面价值并计入资本公积。在确认应享有
被投资单位净损益的份额时，以取得投资时被投资单位各项可辨认资产等的公允价值为基础，对被投资
单位的净利润进行调整后确认。被投资单位采用的会计政策及会计期间与本公司不一致的，按照本公司
的会计政策及会计期间对被投资单位的财务报表进行调整，并据以确认投资收益和其他综合收益。对于
本集团与联营企业及合营企业之间发生的交易，投出或出售的资产不构成业务的，未实现内部交易损益
按照享有的比例计算归属于本集团的部分予以抵销，在此基础上确认投资损益。但本集团与被投资单位
发生的未实现内部交易损失，属于所转让资产减值损失的，不予以抵销。 
 
在确认应分担被投资单位发生的净亏损时，以长期股权投资的账面价值和其他实质上构成对被投资单位
净投资的长期权益减记至零为限。此外，如本集团对被投资单位负有承担额外损失的义务，则按预计承
担的义务确认预计负债，计入当期投资损失。被投资单位以后期间实现净利润的，本集团在收益分享额
弥补未确认的亏损分担额后，恢复确认收益分享额。 
 
18.4  长期股权投资处置 
 
处置长期股权投资时，其账面价值与实际取得价款的差额，计入当期损益。 
 
19. 
固定资产 
 
19.1  
确认条件 
 
固定资产是指为生产商品、提供劳务、出租或经营管理而持有的，使用寿命超过一个会计年度的有形资
产。固定资产仅在与其有关的经济利益很可能流入本集团，且其成本能够可靠地计量时才予以确认。固
定资产按成本进行初始计量。 
 
与固定资产有关的后续支出，如果与该固定资产有关的经济利益很可能流入且其成本能可靠地计量，则
计入固定资产成本，并终止确认被替换部分的账面价值。除此以外的其他后续支出，在发生时计入当期
损益。

19.3  
其他说明 
 
当固定资产处置时或预期通过使用或处置不能产生经济利益时，终止确认该固定资产。固定资产出售、
转让、报废或毁损的处置收入扣除其账面价值和相关税费后的差额计入当期损益。 
 
本集团至少于年度终了对固定资产的使用寿命、预计净残值和折旧方法进行复核，如发生改变则作为会

研发支出的归集范围及相关会计处理方法 
 
研究阶段的支出，于发生时计入当期损益。 
 
开发阶段的支出同时满足下列条件的，确认为无形资产，不能满足下述条件的开发阶段的支出计入当期
损益： 
 
(1) 
完成该无形资产以使其能够使用或出售在技术上具有可行性； 
(2) 
具有完成该无形资产并使用或出售的意图； 
(3) 
无形资产产生经济利益的方式，包括能够证明运用该无形资产生产的产品存在市场或无形资产自
身存在市场，无形资产将在内部使用的，能够证明其有用性； 
(4) 
有足够的技术、财务资源和其他资源支持，以完成该无形资产的开发，并有能力使用或出售该无
形资产； 
(5) 
归属于该无形资产开发阶段的支出能够可靠地计量。 
 
无法区分研究阶段支出和开发阶段支出的，将发生的研发支出全部计入当期损益。内部开发活动形成的

长期资产减值 
 
本集团在每一个资产负债表日检查长期股权投资、固定资产、在建工程、使用权资产及使用寿命确定的
无形资产是否存在可能发生减值的迹象。如果该等资产存在减值迹象，则估计其可收回金额。使用寿命
不确定的无形资产和尚未达到可使用状态的无形资产，无论是否存在减值迹象，每年均进行减值测试。 
 
估计资产的可收回金额以单项资产为基础，如果难以对单项资产的可收回金额进行估计的，则以该资产
所属的资产组为基础确定资产组的可收回金额。可收回金额为资产或者资产组的公允价值减去处置费用
后的净额与其预计未来现金流量的现值两者之中的较高者。 
 
如果资产的可收回金额低于其账面价值，按其差额计提资产减值准备，并计入当期损益。 
 
商誉至少在每年年度终了进行减值测试。对商誉进行减值测试时，结合与其相关的资产组或者资产组组
合进行。即，自购买日起将商誉的账面价值按照合理的方法分摊到能够从企业合并的协同效应中受益的
资产组或资产组组合，如包含分摊的商誉的资产组或资产组组合的可收回金额低于其账面价值的，确认
相应的减值损失。减值损失金额首先抵减分摊到该资产组或资产组组合的商誉的账面价值，再根据资产
组或资产组组合中除商誉以外的其他各项资产的账面价值所占比重，按比例抵减其他各项资产的账面价
值。 
 
上述资产减值损失一经确认，在以后会计期间不予转回。 
 
24. 
长期待摊费用 
 
长期待摊费用为已经发生但应由本年和以后各期负担的分摊期限在一年以上的各项费用，主要为租入固
定资产改良支出及员工住房借款待摊利息。长期待摊费用在预计受益期间3至5年中分期平均摊销。

26.1 
短期薪酬的会计处理方法 
 
本集团在职工为其提供服务的会计期间，将实际发生的短期薪酬确认为负债，并计入当期损益或相关资
产成本。本集团发生的职工福利费，在实际发生时根据实际发生额计入当期损益或相关资产成本。职工
福利费为非货币性福利的，按照公允价值计量。 
 
本集团为职工缴纳的医疗保险费、工伤保险费、生育保险费等社会保险费和住房公积金，以及本集团按
规定提取的工会经费和职工教育经费，在职工为本集团提供服务的会计期间，根据规定的计提基础和计
提比例计算确定相应的职工薪酬金额，确认相应负债，并计入当期损益或相关资产成本。

预计负债 
 
当与产品质量保证等或有事项相关的义务是本集团承担的现时义务，且履行该义务很可能导致经济利益
流出，以及该义务的金额能够可靠地计量，则确认为预计负债。 
 
在资产负债表日，考虑与或有事项有关的风险、不确定性和货币时间价值等因素，按照履行相关现时义
务所需支出的最佳估计数对预计负债进行计量。如果货币时间价值影响重大，则以预计未来现金流出折
现后的金额确定最佳估计数。 
 
本集团根据预计索赔率以及维修和更换成本等估计产品质量保证金。 
 
28. 
股份支付 
 
本集团的股份支付是为了获取职工提供服务而授予权益工具或者承担以权益工具为基础确定的负债的交
易。本集团的股份支付为以权益结算的股份支付。 
 
28.1 
以权益结算的股份支付 
 
对于用以换取职工提供的服务的权益结算的股份支付，本集团以授予职工权益工具在授予日的公允价值
计量。该公允价值的金额在等待期内以对可行权权益工具数量的最佳估计为基础，按直线法计算计入相
关成本或费用，相应增加资本公积。 
 
在等待期内每个资产负债表日，本集团根据最新取得的可行权职工人数变动等后续信息做出最佳估计，
修正预计可行权的权益工具数量。上述估计的影响计入当期相关成本或费用，并相应调整资本公积。 
 
28.2 
实施、修改、终止股份支付计划的相关会计处理 
 
本集团对股份支付计划进行修改时，若修改增加了所授予权益工具的公允价值，按照权益工具公允价值
的增加相应确认取得服务的增加；若修改增加了所授予权益工具的数量，则将增加的权益工具的公允价
值相应地确认为取得服务的增加。权益工具公允价值的增加是指修改前后的权益工具在修改日的公允价
值之间的差额。若修改减少了股份支付公允价值总额或采用了其他不利于职工的方式修改股份支付计划
的条款和条件，则仍继续对取得的服务进行会计处理，视同该变更从未发生，除非本集团取消了部分或
全部已授予的权益工具。 
 
在等待期内，如果取消了授予的权益工具，本集团对取消所授予的权益性工具作为加速行权处理，将剩
余等待期内应确认的金额立即计入当期损益，同时确认资本公积。职工能够选择满足非可行权条件但在
等待期内未满足的，本集团将其作为授予权益工具的取消处理。

收入 
 
本集团的收入为产品销售收入、工程施工收入和云服务及其他服务收入。 
 
本集团在履行了合同中的履约义务，即在客户取得相关商品或服务控制权时，按照分摊至该项履约义务
的交易价格确认收入。履约义务，是指合同中本集团向客户转让可明确区分商品或服务的承诺。 
 
本集团在合同开始日对合同进行评估，识别该合同所包含的各单项履约义务，并确定各单项履约义务是
在某一时段内履行，还是在某一时点履行。满足下列条件之一的，属于在某一时间段内履行的履约义务，
本集团按照履约进度，在一段时间内确认收入：(1)客户在本集团履约的同时即取得并消耗所带来的经济
利益；(2)客户能够控制本集团履约过程中在建的商品；(3)本集团履约过程中所产出的商品具有不可替代
用途，且本集团在整个合同期间内有权就累计至今已完成的履约部分收取款项。否则，本集团在客户取
得相关商品或服务控制权的时点确认收入。 
 
合同中包含两项或多项履约义务的，本集团在合同开始日，按照各单项履约义务所承诺商品或服务的单
独售价的相对比例，将交易价格分摊至各单项履约义务。但在有确凿证据表明合同折扣或可变对价仅与
合同中一项或多项(而非全部)履约义务相关的，本集团将该合同折扣或可变对价分摊至相关一项或多项
履约义务。单独售价，是指本集团向客户单独销售商品或服务的价格。单独售价无法直接观察的，本集
团综合考虑能够合理取得的全部相关信息，并最大限度地采用可观察的输入值估计单独售价。 
 
本集团根据在向客户转让商品或服务前是否拥有对该服务的控制权，来判断从事交易时本集团的身份是
主要责任人还是代理人。本集团在向客户转让商品或服务前能够控制该商品或服务的，本集团为主要责
任人，按照已收或应收对价总额确认收入；否则，本集团为代理人，按照预期有权收取的佣金或手续费
的金额确认收入，该金额按照已收或应收对价总额扣除应支付给其他相关方的价款后的净额或者按照既
定的佣金金额或比例等确定。 
 
29.1 
产品销售收入 
 
产品销售收入系本集团销售视频监控产品、智能家居产品、机器人产品、热成像产品、汽车电子产品及
存储产品及其他产品相关的收入。 
 
本集团根据合同规定，在产品的控制权转移时，即产品交给约定的承运人或者运送至对方指定地点经过
签收时确认收入。由于产品交付给客户代表了取得无条件收取合同对价的权利，款项的到期仅取决于时
间流逝，故本集团在产品交付给客户时确认一项应收款。当客户预付货款时，本集团将收到的交易金额
确认为一项合同负债，直至产品被交付予客户时确认收入。 
 
本集团与经销商的产品销售合同中存在可变对价。本集团按照预期交付产品的时间、数量及价格等确定
可变对价的最佳估计数。包含可变对价的交易价格，不超过在相关不确定性消除时累计已确认收入极可
能不会发生重大转回的金额。每一资产负债表日，本集团重新估计应计入交易价格的可变对价金额。 
 
本集团向经销商销售产品时提供了销售激励措施的额外购买选择权，即本集团经销商在向本集团购买特
定产品时可以积累销售返点，并在未来购买商品时用其抵扣价款。这些销售返点向经销商在其未来购买
商品时提供了同类客户无法享有的折扣。因此，向经销商提供该未来采购款的抵扣的承诺是一项单独的
履约义务，在销售交易发生时该承诺按根据返点公允价值分摊到的交易价格确认为一项合同负债，在经
销商使用销售返点抵扣价款时确认收入。

递延所得税资产及递延所得税负债 
 
对于某些资产、负债项目的账面价值与其计税基础之间的差额，以及未作为资产和负债确认但按照税法
规定可以确定其计税基础的项目的账面价值与计税基础之间的差额产生的暂时性差异，采用资产负债表
债务法确认递延所得税资产及递延所得税负债。 
 
一般情况下所有暂时性差异均确认相关的递延所得税。但对于可抵扣暂时性差异，本集团以很可能取得
用来抵扣可抵扣暂时性差异的应纳税所得额为限，确认相关的递延所得税资产。此外，与商誉的初始确
认相关的，以及与既不是企业合并、发生时也不影响会计利润和应纳税所得额(或可抵扣亏损)且不导致
等额应纳税暂时性差异和可抵扣暂时性差异的交易中产生的资产或负债的初始确认有关的暂时性差异，
不予确认有关的递延所得税资产或负债。 
 
对于能够结转以后年度的可抵扣亏损及税款抵减，以很可能获得用来抵扣可抵扣亏损和税款抵减的未来
应纳税所得额为限，确认相应的递延所得税资产。 
 
本集团确认与子公司投资相关的应纳税暂时性差异产生的递延所得税负债，除非本集团能够控制暂时性
差异转回的时间，而且该暂时性差异在可预见的未来很可能不会转回。对于与子公司投资相关的可抵扣
暂时性差异，只有当暂时性差异在可预见的未来很可能转回，且未来很可能获得用来抵扣可抵扣暂时性
差异的应纳税所得额时，本集团才确认递延所得税资产。 
 
资产负债表日，对于递延所得税资产和递延所得税负债，根据税法规定，按照预期收回相关资产或清偿
相关负债期间的适用税率计量。 
 
除与直接计入其他综合收益或股东权益的交易和事项相关的当期所得税和递延所得税计入其他综合收益
或股东权益，以及企业合并产生的递延所得税调整商誉的账面价值外，其余当期所得税和递延所得税费
用或收益计入当期损益。 
 
资产负债表日，对递延所得税资产的账面价值进行复核，如果未来很可能无法获得足够的应纳税所得额
用以抵扣递延所得税资产的利益，则减记递延所得税资产的账面价值。在很可能获得足够的应纳税所得
额时，减记的金额予以转回。

33.1.1 租赁的分拆 
 
合同中同时包含一项或多项租赁和非租赁部分的，本集团将各项单独租赁和非租赁部分进行分拆，按照
各租赁部分单独价格及非租赁部分的单独价格之和的相对比例分摊合同对价。 
 
33.1.2 使用权资产 
 
除短期租赁和低价值资产租赁外，本集团在租赁期开始日对租赁确认使用权资产。租赁期开始日，是指
出租人提供租赁资产使其可供本集团使用的起始日期。使用权资产按照成本进行初始计量。该成本包括： 
 
 
租赁负债的初始计量金额； 
 
在租赁期开始日或之前支付的租赁付款额，存在租赁激励的，扣除已享受的租赁激励相关金
额； 
 
本集团发生的初始直接费用； 
 
本集团为拆卸及移除租赁资产、复原租赁资产所在场地或将租赁资产恢复至租赁条款约定状态
预计将发生的成本，不包括属于为生产存货而发生的成本。 
 
本集团参照《企业会计准则第4 号——固定资产》有关折旧规定，对使用权资产计提折旧。本集团能够
合理确定租赁期届满时取得租赁资产所有权的，使用权资产在租赁资产剩余使用寿命内计提折旧。无法
合理确定租赁期届满时能够取得租赁资产所有权的，在租赁期与租赁资产剩余使用寿命两者孰短的期间
内计提折旧。 
 
本集团按照《企业会计准则第8 号——资产减值》的规定来确定使用权资产是否已发生减值，并对已识
别的减值损失进行会计处理。 
 
33.1.3 租赁负债 
 
除短期租赁和低价值资产租赁外，本集团在租赁期开始日按照该日尚未支付的租赁付款额的现值对租赁
负债进行初始计量。在计算租赁付款额的现值时，本集团采用租赁内含利率作为折现率，无法确定租赁
内含利率的，采用增量借款利率作为折现率。 
 
租赁付款额是指本集团向出租人支付的与在租赁期内使用租赁资产的权利相关的款项，包括： 
 
 
固定付款额及实质固定付款额，存在租赁激励的，扣除租赁激励相关金额；

 
因租赁期变化或购买选择权的评估结果发生变化的，本集团按变动后租赁付款额和修订后的折
现率计算的现值重新计量租赁负债； 
 
根据担保余值预计的应付金额发生变动，本集团按照变动后的租赁付款额和原折现率计算的现
值重新计量租赁负债。 
 
33.1.4 作为承租方对短期租赁和低价值资产租赁进行简化处理的判断依据和会计处理方法 
 
本集团对短期租赁以及低价值资产租赁选择不确认使用权资产和租赁负债。短期租赁，是指在租赁期开
始日，租赁期不超过12 个月且不包含购买选择权的租赁。低价值资产租赁，是指单项租赁资产为全新
资产时价值较低的租赁。本集团将短期租赁和低价值资产租赁的租赁付款额，在租赁期内各个期间按照
直线法计入当期损益或相关资产成本。 
 
33.1.5 租赁变更 
 
租赁发生变更且同时符合下列条件的，本集团将该租赁变更作为一项单独租赁进行会计处理： 
 
 
该租赁变更通过增加一项或多项租赁资产的使用权而扩大了租赁范围； 
 
增加的对价与租赁范围扩大部分的单独价格按该合同情况调整后的金额相当。 
 
租赁变更未作为一项单独租赁进行会计处理的，在租赁变更生效日，本集团重新分摊变更后合同的对价，
重新确定租赁期，并按照变更后租赁付款额和修订后的折现率计算的现值重新计量租赁负债。 
 
租赁变更导致租赁范围缩小或租赁期缩短的，本集团相应调减使用权资产的账面价值，并将部分终止或
完全终止租赁的相关利得或损失计入当期损益。其他租赁变更导致租赁负债重新计量的，本集团相应调
整使用权资产的账面价值。

33.2.1 租赁的分拆 
 
合同中同时包含租赁和非租赁部分的，本集团根据《企业会计准则第14 号——收入》关于交易价格分

33.2.2 作为出租方租赁的分类标准和会计处理方法 
 
实质上转移了与租赁资产所有权有关的几乎全部风险和报酬的租赁为融资租赁。融资租赁以外的其他租
赁为经营租赁。

租赁投资净额为未担保余值和租赁期开始日尚未收到的租赁收款额按照租赁内含利率折现的现值之和。 
 
租赁收款额，是指本集团因让渡在租赁期内使用租赁资产的权利而应向承租人收取的款项，包括： 
 
 
承租人需支付的固定付款额及实质固定付款额，存在租赁激励的，扣除租赁激励相关金额； 
 
购买选择权的行权价格，前提是合理确定承租人将行使该选择权；

经营租赁发生变更的，本集团自变更生效日起将其作为一项新租赁进行会计处理，与变更前租赁有关的
预收或应收租赁收款额视为新租赁的收款额。

 
该变更通过增加一项或多项租赁资产的使用权而扩大了租赁范围； 
 
增加的对价与租赁范围扩大部分的单独价格按该合同情况调整后的金额相当。 
 
融资租赁的变更未作为一项单独租赁进行会计处理的，本集团分别下列情形对变更后的租赁进行处理： 
 
 
假如变更在租赁开始日生效，该租赁会被分类为经营租赁的，本集团自租赁变更生效日开始将
其作为一项新租赁进行会计处理，并以租赁变更生效日前的租赁投资净额作为租赁资产的账面
价值；

运用会计政策过程中所作的重要判断和会计估计所采用的关键假设和不确定因素 
 
本集团在运用附注(三)所描述的会计政策过程中，由于经营活动内在的不确定性，本集团需要对无法准
确计量的报表项目的账面价值进行判断、估计和假设。这些判断、估计和假设是基于本集团管理层过去
的历史经验，并在考虑其他相关因素的基础上作出的。实际的结果可能与本集团的估计存在差异。 
 
本集团对前述判断、估计和假设在持续经营的基础上进行定期复核，会计估计的变更仅影响变更当期的，
其影响数在变更当期予以确认；既影响变更当期又影响未来期间的，其影响数在变更当期和未来期间予
以确认。 
 
- 会计估计所采用的关键假设和不确定因素 
 
资产负债表日，会计估计中很可能导致未来期间资产、负债账面价值作出重大调整的关键假设和不确定
性主要有： 
 
存货跌价准备 
 
除合同履约成本外，存货按照成本与可变现净值孰低计量。对于原材料，以最近或期后的实际采购价格
作为确定可变现净值的依据；对于在产品，以最近或期后同类产成品的实际售价减去当期同类在产品至
完工时估计将要发生的成本、估计将要发生的销售费用及相关税费后的金额作为确定可变现净值的依据；
对于产成品，以最近或期后产成品的实际售价减去估计将要发生的销售费用及相关税费后的金额作为确
定可变现净值的依据。本集团会定期对存货进行全面盘点来确定是否存在残次、过时或呆滞的存货并复
核其减值情况，此外，本集团管理层会定期根据存货库龄复核长库龄存货的减值情况。基于上述程序，
本集团管理层认为已对存货提取了足额的跌价准备，具体情况详见附注(五)、9。 
 
应收账款的减值 
 
除在单项资产的基础上确定其信用损失的应收账款，本集团在组合基础上采用减值矩阵确定相关应收账
款的预期信用损失。本集团按照业务的区域和对象划分风险特征，将相关应收账款分为不同组合，基于
历史损失率并考虑合理且有依据的行业前瞻性信息对不同组合的各类应收账款确定相应的损失准备的比
例。于2024年12月31日，本集团基于历史损失率并考虑合理且有依据的前瞻性信息对应收账款确定相应
的损失准备的比例。该预期信用损失准备的金额将随本集团的估计而发生变化。本集团的应收账款的预
期信用损失准备的具体情况详见附注(五)、4。 
 
固定资产的使用寿命及预计净残值 
 
本集团对固定资产可使用寿命的估计是根据对类似性质及功能的固定资产实际可使用年限的历史经验为
基础，对预计净残值的估计是根据假定固定资产预计使用寿命已满并处于使用寿命终了时的预期状态，
本集团目前从该项资产处置中获得的扣除预计处置费用后的金额。本集团至少于每年年度终了对固定资
产的预计使用寿命及预计净残值进行复核，本年度本集团管理层未发现使本集团固定资产使用寿命缩短
或延长及需要改变预计净残值的情况。

产品质量保证预计负债 
 
产品质量保证预计负债是基于产品合同中向客户保证所销售商品符合既定标准的质量保证义务所需承担
的成本费用，本集团根据预计的相关产品索赔率、维修和更换成本作出估计。管理层认为目前的产品质
量保证预计负债的估计是合理的，但本集团将继续检视产品返修情况，一旦有迹象表明需要调整相关会
计估计的假设，本集团将在有关迹象发生的期间进行调整。 
 
递延所得税资产和递延所得税负债 
 
递延所得税资产和递延所得税负债按照预期收回相关资产或清偿相关债务期间的适用所得税税率计量。
预期适用所得税税率是根据有关现行的税务法规及本集团的实际情况而确定。若预期所得税税率与原估
计有差异，本集团管理层将对其进行调整。 
 
递延所得税资产的实现主要取决于未来的实际应纳税所得额和应纳税暂时性差异，以及暂时性差异在未
来使用年度的实际税率。如未来实际产生的应纳税所得额和应纳税暂时性差异少于预期，或实际税率低
于预期，确认的递延所得税资产将被转回，确认在转回发生期间的损益表中。如未来实际产生的应纳税
所得额和应纳税暂时性差异多于预期，或实际税率高于预期，将确认部分未确认的可抵扣亏损和可抵扣
暂时性差异的递延所得税资产，确认在该情况发生期间的损益表中。 
 
商誉减值 
 
在对商誉进行减值测试时，需确定一个适当地反映当前市场货币时间价值和资产特定风险的折现率，并
计算包含商誉的相关资产组或者资产组组合的预计未来现金流量现值。当未来的实际结果与原先的预计
不同时，商誉减值测试的结果将会发生变化。

解释第 17 号对《企业会计准则第30 号——财务报表列报》中流动负债和非流动负债的划分原则进行
了修订完善：明确了若企业在资产负债表日没有将负债清偿推迟至资产负债表日后一年以上的实质性权
利，该负债应当归类为流动负债，企业是否行使上述权利的主观可能性，并不影响负债的流动性划分；
明确了对于企业贷款安排产生的负债，企业将负债清偿推迟至资产负债表日后一年以上的权利可能取决
于契约条件时，应当区别企业在资产负债表日或之前和资产负债表日之后应遵循的契约条件，考虑在资
产负债表日是否具有推迟清偿负债的权利；澄清了如果企业负债的交易对手方可以选择以企业自身权益
工具进行清偿且该选择权分类为权益工具并单独确认，则相关清偿条款与该负债的流动性划分无关；以
及明确了附有契约条件且归类为非流动负债的贷款安排相关信息披露要求。同时要求企业在首次执行本
规定时，应当对可比期间信息进行调整。 
 
经评估，本集团认为采用上述规定对本集团财务报表并无重大影响。

关于售后租回交易的会计处理 
 
解释第 17 号规定售后租回交易中的资产转让属于销售的，在租赁期开始日后，承租人在对售后租回所
形成的租赁负债进行后续计量时，确定租赁付款额或变更后租赁付款额的方式不得导致其确认与租回所
获得的使用权有关的利得或损失。租赁变更导致租赁范围缩小或租赁期缩短的，承租人将部分终止或完
全终止租赁的相关利得或损失计入当期损益，不受上述规定的限制。企业在首次执行时，应当对《企业
会计准则第21 号——租赁》首次执行日后开展的售后租回交易进行追溯调整。 
 
经评估，本集团认为采用上述规定对本集团财务报表并无重大影响。 
 
解释第18 号 
 
解释第 18 号规范了关于不属于单项履约义务的保证类质量保证的会计处理，自2024 年12 月6 日起
施行，允许企业自发布年度提前执行。 
 
关于不属于单项履约义务的保证类质量保证的会计处理 
 
解释第 18 号规定，根据《企业会计准则第 14 号——收入》在对因不属于单项履约义务的保证类质量
保证产生的预计负债进行会计核算时，应当根据《企业会计准则第 13 号——或有事项》有关规定，按
确定的预计负债金额，借记“主营业务成本”、“其他业务成本”等科目，贷记“预计负债”科目，并相应在
利润表中的“营业成本”和资产负债表中的“其他流动负债”、“一年内到期的非流动负债”、“预计负债”
等项目列示。企业在首次执行该解释内容时，如原计提保证类质量保证时计入“销售费用”等的，应将上
述保证类质量保证会计处理涉及的会计科目和报表列报项目的变更作为会计政策变更进行追溯调整。本
集团原计提保证类质量保证时计入了“销售费用”，本年度提前执行了该规定。对本集团2023 年度合并

商誉的减值准备 
 
本集团在年末对商誉进行减值测试时，采用的关键假设及其依据如下：  
 
包含分摊的商誉的资产组组合的可收回金额按照相关资产组组合预计未来现金流量的现值确定。其未来
现金流量的预测期年限均为5 年。未来现金流量的预计是管理层基于过去的业绩和对市场发展的预期所
估计的预计期间的销售收入和销售成本、经营费用后得出的。超过5 年的现金流量增长率为0-2%。 
 
本年度本集团未发现包含分摊的商誉的相关资产组组合的可收回金额低于其账面价值的情况，故认为无
需对商誉计提减值损失。

本集团采用敏感性分析技术分析风险变量的合理、可能变化对当期损益和股东权益可能产生的影响。由
于任何风险变量很少孤立地发生变化，而变量之间存在的相关性对某一风险变量的变化的最终影响金额
将产生重大作用，因此下述内容是在假设每一变量的变化是在独立的情况下进行的。 
 
1、 
风险管理目标、政策和程序，以及本期发生的变化 
 
本集团从事风险管理的目标是在风险和收益之间取得适当的平衡，将风险对本集团经营业绩的负面影响
降低到最低水平，使股东及其其他权益投资者的利益最大化。基于该风险管理目标，本集团风险管理的
基本策略是确定和分析本集团所面临的各种风险，建立适当的风险承受底线和进行风险管理，并及时可
靠地对各种风险进行监督，将风险控制在限定的范围之内。

市场风险 
 
1.1.1 外汇风险 
 
外汇风险指因汇率变动产生损失的风险。本集团承受外汇风险主要与美元、欧元等货币有关。本集团位
于中国大陆境内的公司主要以人民币、美元、欧元进行采购、销售及融资活动，其他主要业务活动以人
民币计价结算；本集团位于中国香港地区和中国境外的子公司主要以美元、欧元等当地货币进行采购、
销售、融资及其他主要业务活动。 
 
于本年末，除附注(五)、61 所述外币货币性项目外，本集团的资产及负债主要为以各子公司的记账本位
币计价结算。在外币货币性项目中，下表所述美元和欧元余额(已折算为人民币)的资产和负债产生的外
汇风险可能对本集团的经营业绩产生重大影响。

汇风险敞口。 
 
外汇风险敏感性分析 
 
本集团的外汇风险敏感性分析仅包括以外币计价的货币性项目，未考虑所购买的衍生金融工具的影响。

1.1.2 利率风险 
 
本集团因利率变动引起金融工具现金流量变动的风险主要与浮动利率银行借款(详见附注(五)、24 及附注
(五)、34))及浮动利率银行存款有关。本集团因利率变动引起金融工具公允价值变动的风险主要与固定利
率银行借款(详见附注(五)、24 及附注(五)、34)及固定利率银行存款有关。 
 
本集团根据当时的市场环境来决定固定利率及浮动利率借款合同的相对比例。于2024 年12 月31 日，本
集团固定利率的长短期带息债务合计为人民币5,538,078,464.46 元(2023 年12 月31 日：人民币
11,105,877,902.09 元)，浮动利率的长短期带息债务合计为人民币1,165,181,524.22 元(2023 年12 月31
日：人民币5,546,156,677.17 元)。

1.1.2 利率风险 - 续 
 
本集团目前并无利率互换等安排，将持续密切关注借款利率变动对于本集团利率风险的影响，并会依据
最新的市场情况及时做出调整。 
 
本集团预期浮动利率银行存款产生的现金流量风险敞口和固定利率银行存款产生的公允价值变动的风险
敞口均不重大。 
 
1.1.3 其他价格风险 
 
本集团的价格风险主要产生于交易性权益工具投资及衍生金融工具。交易性权益工具投资全部为非上市
交易性权益工具投资。 
 
本集团因持有以公允价值计量的金融资产而面临价格风险。由于某些金融工具的公允价值是按照未来现
金流量折现法为基础的通用定价模型或其他估值技术确定的，而估值技术本身基于一定的估值假设。因
此估值结果对估值假设具有重大的敏感性。但本集团年末交易性权益工具投资及衍生金融工具金额不重
大，改变估值假设引起金融工具价格变动的影响金额不重大，因此不进行敏感性分析。 
 
1.2 
信用风险 
 
2024 年12 月31 日，可能引起本集团财务损失的最大信用风险敞口主要来自于合同另一方未能履行义务
而导致本集团金融资产产生的损失，具体包括：货币资金(附注(五)、1)、应收票据(附注(五)、3)、应收账
款(附注(五)、4)、应收款项融资(附注(五)、6)、其他应收款(附注(五)、8)、合同资产(附注(五)、5 及附注
(五)、22)、一年内到期的非流动资产(附注(五)、10)、长期应收款(附注(五)、12)等，以及未纳入减值评估
范围的以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的衍生金融资产(附注(五)、2)。于资产负债表日，本集团
金融资产的账面价值已代表其最大信用风险敞口。 
 
为降低信用风险，本集团已安排专门团队确定信用额度、进行信用审批，并执行其他监控程序以确保采
取必要的措施回收逾期债务。此外，本集团于每个资产负债表日审核金融资产的回收情况，以确保对相
关金融资产计提了充分的信用损失准备。因此，本集团管理层认为本集团所承担的信用风险已经大为降
低。 
 
本集团的货币资金存放在信用评级较高的银行，故货币资金只具有较低的信用风险。 
 
对于应收账款、合同资产和长期应收款，本集团设定相关政策以控制信用风险敞口。本集团基于对客户
的财务状况、从第三方获取担保的可能性、信用记录及其他因素诸如目前市场状况等评估客户的信用资
质并设置相应信用期。本集团会定期对客户的信用记录进行监控，对于信用记录不良的客户，本集团会
采用书面催款、缩短信用期或取消信用期等方式，以确保本集团的整体信用风险在可控的范围内。对于
应收账款及合同资产，本集团按照简化方法，即按照相当于整个存续期内预期信用损失的金额计量损失
准备，相关预期信用损失计量详见(附注(五)、4 及附注(五)、5)。对于长期应收款，本集团根据违约风险
敞口按未来12 个月或整个存续期内的预期信用损失率，计算预期信用损失，相关预期信用损失计量详见
(附注(五)、12)。

信用风险 - 续 
 
对于应收银行承兑汇票和应收债权凭证，本集团认为其不存在重大的信用风险，不会产生因对方单位违
约而导致的任何重大损失。对于应收财务公司承兑汇票和商业承兑汇票，本集团设定相关政策以控制信
用风险敞口。本集团基于对承兑方的财务状况、信用记录及其他因素诸如目前市场状况等评估承兑方的
信用状况并设置内部信用评级。本集团会定期对承兑方信用记录进行监控，对于信用记录不良的承兑方，
本集团会采用书面催款等方式，以确保本集团的整体信用风险在可控的范围内。对于应收财务公司承兑
汇票和商业承兑汇票，本集团根据违约风险敞口按整个存续期内的预期信用损失率，计算预期信用损失，
相关预期信用损失计量详见(附注(五)、3)。 
 
对于其他应收款，本集团会定期对债务人信用记录进行监控，对于信用记录不良的债务人，本集团会采
用书面催款等方式，以确保本集团的整体信用风险在可控的范围内。对于其他应收款，本集团根据违约
风险敞口按未来12 个月或整个存续期内的预期信用损失率，计算预期信用损失，相关预期信用损失计量
详见(附注(五)、8)。 
 
本集团的风险敞口分布在多个合同方和多个客户，因此本集团无重大信用集中风险。 
 
1.3 
流动性风险 
 
管理流动性风险时，本集团保持管理层认为充分的现金及现金等价物并对其进行监控，以满足本集团经
营需要，并降低现金流量波动的影响。本集团管理层对银行借款的使用情况进行监控并确保遵守借款协
议。

限制性股票激励计划 
 
经国务院国有资产监督管理委员会《关于杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司实施限制性股票激励计划
的批复》(国资分配[2012]426 号)和中国证券监督管理委员会《关于杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司
限制性股票激励计划的意见》(上市部函[2012]353 号)的批准，公司于2012 年7 月25 日第二届董事会九
次会议，及2012 年8 月13 日2012 年第一次临时股东大会审议通过了《关于公司〈限制性股票计划(草
案修订稿)〉及摘要的议案》。该股权激励计划的目的是：进一步完善公司治理结构，形成良好、均衡的
价值分配体系；建立股东、公司与员工之间的利益共享与约束机制，为股东带来持续回报；充分调动核
心员工的积极性，支持公司战略实现和长期可持续发展；吸引和保留核心员工，确保公司长期发展。 
 
本计划的有效期为10 年，自股东大会批准之日起生效。在计划有效期内，公司可以依据本计划向激励对
象授予限制性股票。原则上每次授予之间需间隔两年。计划有效期满后，公司不得依据本计划向激励对
象授予任何限制性股票；但本计划的各项条款对依据本计划授出的限制性股票依然有效。 
 
公司和激励对象每次需同时满足公司解锁业绩条件(包括净资产收益率、营业收入增长率和经济增加值)
和个人业绩条件，每批次限制性股票方可解锁。当解锁期内有一个或一个以上公司或个人解锁条件未达
成的，该部分标的股票作废。作废的限制性股票将由公司根据本计划的相关规定进行回购。 
 
公司于2022 年1 月18 日，根据2022 年第一次临时股东大会授权，经董事会审议通过，向激励对象授予
限制性股票97,402,605 股，限制性股票授予价格为29.71 元/股(“2021 股权激励”)。在授予日后的24 个月
为标的股票锁定期，激励对象根据本计划持有的标的股票将被锁定且不得以任何形式转让；限制性股票
授予后(包括锁定期内)的24 个月至60 个月为解锁期，在解锁期内，若达到本股权激励计划规定的解锁
条件，授予的限制性股票分三次解锁：第一次解锁期为授予日24 个月后至36 个月内，解锁数量是当次
获授标的股票总数的40%；第二次解锁期为授予日36 个月后至48 个月内，解锁数量是当次获授标的股
票总数的30%；第三次解锁期为授予日48 个月后至60 个月内，解锁数量是当次获授标的股票总数的
30%。公司于2022 年2 月完成股权登记工作。

员工跟投创新业务计划 
 
公司于2015 年10 月22 日第二次临时股东大会审议通过《核心员工跟投创新业务管理办法(草案)》(以下
简称“管理办法”)，于2016 年3 月7 日，海康威视工会代表大会通过了《核心员工跟投创新业务管理办
法实施细则》(以下简称“细则”)，对创新业务子公司启动实施员工跟投的激励机制(以下简称“员工跟投计
划”)。参与员工跟投计划的员工(以下简称“跟投员工”)与海康威视工会委员会(以下简称“海康威视工会”)
签署《委托投资协议》，委托海康威视工会进行投资，海康威视工会作为委托人与信托公司合作，设立
信托计划，由信托公司作为合伙企业的有限合伙人，将信托资金投资于创新业务子公司。(上述跟投形式
简称“跟投平台”)。 
 
员工跟投计划根据适用对象不同分为A 计划和B 计划。A 计划的对象系由公司及其下属分子公司的中高
层管理人员和核心骨干员工组成，跟投所有创新业务。B 计划的对象系由创新业务及其下属分子公司核
心员工且是全职员工组成，参与跟投其所在的创新业务子公司。跟投平台每年进行增资，增资部分对应
的平台权益根据特定规则分配给符合跟投条件的核心员工。员工自持有跟投平台权益后的5 年为等待期。
在等待期内激励对象与公司或子公司的劳动关系解除或终止，则持有的跟投平台份额将由工会根据细则
约定的价格退还份额清算价款。 
 
跟投平台每年新增份额授予跟投员工，本集团于每个授予日根据本集团员工新获得的跟投平台权益工具
的公允价值判断是否构成股份支付。 
 
2020 年12 月，跟投员工与海康威视工会签订了《委托投资协议》之《补充协议》(以下简称“《补充协
议》”)。公司于2020 年12 月25 日召开第四届董事会第二十次会议，审议通过了《关于修订<核心员工
跟投创新业务管理办法>的议案》。新版《核心员工跟投创新业务管理办法》(以下简称“新版《管理办法》”)
增加了对员工持有跟投计划份额和间接持有创新业务子公司的权益进行确权，明确了员工丧失或被取消
跟投资格后跟投份额的处理方法、增加管理委员会等制度。 
 
于2020 年12 月31 日，跟投方案执行管理委员会通过了《核心员工跟投创新业务管理办法实施细则》
(以下简称“新版细则”)。根据新版《管理办法》和新版细则，对于已确权的A 计划份额，等待期为该员
工于公司或其分子公司工作满五周年；对于已确权的B 计划份额，等待期为该员工于该B 计划对应的创
新业务子公司或其下属分子公司工作满五周年。

限制性股票激励计划  
 
鉴于目前的经营环境与制定 2021 年限制性股票计划时发生了较大变化，继续实施该次限制性股票计划
以达到预期的激励目的和效果难度加大。本公司于2024 年4 月18 日召开第五届董事会第二十次会议、
第五届监事会第十八次会议、2024 年5 月10 日召开 2023 年年度股东大会，审议通过《关于终止实施
2021 年限制性股票计划并回购注销相关限制性股票的议案》，同意终止实施2021 年限制性股票计划并
对 2021 年限制性股票计划已经授予但尚未解锁的全部限制性股票进行回购注销。公司于2024 年8 月
15 日办妥注销登记。根据《企业会计准则》的相关规定，本公司对本次终止实施限制性股票计划做加速
行权处理，确认股份支付费用人民币471,167,293.91 元。

按组合计提坏账准备的应收账款说明： 
 
作为本公司信用风险管理的一部分，本公司按照业务的区域和对象的风险特征将应收账款划分为组合A、组合B 和组合C，并基于应收账款超信用期账龄采用减
值矩阵确定每个组合的预期信用损失。对于集团内子公司产生的应收账款，由于付款时间由集团根据集团内各公司的现金流情况予以安排，本公司认为信用风险
低，无须计提坏账准备。账龄信息能反映这三类客户于应收账款到期时的偿付能力。

To Shareholders 
The business performance of Hikvision kept improving on a quarterly basis in 2023. Despite the 
uneven performance of the Company’s five business groups-PBG, EBG, SMBG, overseas main 
business and the innovative business, greater stability in the operation has been achieved by Hikvision, 
in a complex and volatile business environment. 
Regardless of our performance, Hikvision has resolutely increased investment in research and 
development as we have always believed in long-term efforts. Over the past eight years, Hikvision 
has gradually expanded perception technology from visible light to centimeter wave, millimeter wave, 
far-infrared, medium wave infrared, shortwave infrared, ultraviolet and X-ray, as well as to infrasound 
wave, acoustic wave, and ultrasonic wave. By combining perception with AI technologies, we have 
gradually built and improved our AIoT technology system, launched and improved the products and 
solutions, which contributed to the business growth. The survellience business is currently one of the 
business directions of the Company's AIoT strategy. We have enhanced our competitiveness in the 
survellience industry by increasing non-visible light detector product lines or integrating multiple 
detector product lines. Scenario-based digitalization, especially scenario-based digitalization for 
enterprises, is another direction of our AIoT strategy. Hikvision has launched some product lines in 
this field and is becoming an OT (Operational Technology) manufacturer. Looking digital 
transformation of various businesses. We seek to become a partner of varied businesses in their digital 
transformation journey by continuously improving our internal operational mechanisms and 
optimizing our operational processes. We believe that digital transformation of businesses is a long 
process that provides immense potential for our future business growth. 
Hikvision has applied AI technology to various perception products and combined AI with big 
data technologies for use in system solutions. While exploring and developing industrial large models 
and industrial large multimodal models, we will continue to develop industry software to provide 
more suitable products and system solutions for users. 
Hikvision is committed to the internationalization strategy. Although severely suppressed in 
some countries, the Company has been increasing investment in overseas markets, resulting in

Please read the full annual report and pay particular attention to the following risk factors:  
1) 
Geopolitical risks: Global geopolitical uncertainty remains acute as the political landscape is being 
fragmented and reshaped, and local wars continue. In recent years, the Company has continuously strengthened 
our risk control and response capabilities, and flexibly adjusted resources based on business opportunities. 
However, our operations in some countries and regions may be adversely affected should geopolitical 
environment continues to deteriorate. 
2) 
Global economic downside risks: In addition to slower growth and entrenched currency oversupply in some 
major economies, different regions across the world develop at different rates, presenting a hidden risk that is 
difficult to eliminate. The Company disperses the risk of operating in a single region with a wide business 
layout and conducts business based on the actual situation of various countries and regions. However, the 
Company's business will be impacted if another global economic recession arises 
3) 
Risks of domestic economic structural transformation: The infrastructure and real estate markets in China 
continue to undergo adjustments. The exports of some commodities are restricted by trade protection policies 
of destination countries, and the advantage of a large labor force is weakened. The Chinese economy is in a 
process of transformation of development mode and alternation of new and old driving forces. The Company 
empowers the digital transformation of the economy and society with AIoT technologies and products, 
promoting new developments in productivity. However, economic transformation cannot be achieved 
overnight, and structural pressure and resistance will persist for a long time. Any problems that occur during 
the process will still affect the Company's business operations. 
4) 
Supply chain risks: The integrity of the global supply system is undermined by geopolitics, and the timeliness 
of the supply chain is affected by business cycles. The Company strives to develop a diversified supply network 
and adjust inventory properly. However, our business stability may be affected if the supply chain is seriously 
interrupted. 
5) 
Technology upgrading risks: With the rapid development of AI, big data, IoT and other technologies, 
technological applications are iterating quickly. The Company has some strength in technology fields such as 
IoT perception, AI, and big data, and keeps growing through business practices. However, if we cannot closely 
track the updates and changes of cutting-edge technologies and maintain business innovation and expansion, 
the uncertainty of the Company's future development will increase.

6) 
Risks of internal management: The Company's continual business expansion and development of new 
products and business services add complexity to internal management, posing new challenges to our 
management capabilities. The Company accumulates management experience through the development of 
systems and procedures with a focus on talent cultivation and construction. However, the Company's operations 
will be adversely affected if our management capabilities cannot keep up with the business expansion. 
7) 
Legal and compliance risks: The world's multilateral trading system is greatly impacted by politics, and 
business activities are required to comply with the complex laws and regulations of various regions. The 
Company has constantly strengthened the legal compliance system since countries around the world have 
stricter requirements for data supervision and legal compliance capabilities. However, the Company's 
operations will be adversely affected if our legal compliance capabilities cannot keep up with the requirements. 
8) 
Risks of exchange rate fluctuations: The Company operates in multiple countries and regions, where 
transactions are mainly settled in non-RMB currencies. Although the Company uses appropriate financial 
instruments to reduce risks, exchange rate fluctuations will affect our financial performance due to the foreign 
currency exposure arising from sales, procurement, and financing. 
9) 
Financial risks caused by customers' reduced ability to pay: The flow of funds in commercial transactions 
is affected by the economic environment. The Company has accumulated some cash reserves due to our sound 
collection mechanism and stable business operations, and our financing costs are low. However, if the overall 
liquidity risk of the market increases, the Company's operations will be adversely affected as our payment 
collection maybe delayed. 
10) Risks of cybersecurity: The Company has always emphasized cybersecurity and taken active measures to 
enhance the security of our products and systems. However, computer viruses, malicious software, hacker 
attacks and other security incidents that deliberately attempt to damage the Company's systems or products 
may take place, causing potential cybersecurity issues. 
11) Risks of intellectual property (IP) rights: The Company has maintained considerable investment in R&D, 
and made significant technological achievements. We have also implemented robust IP protection measures. 
However, the risk of IP disputes and infringement still exists. 
The above-mentioned alerts do not include all the potential risks for the Company. Investors are advised to invest 
with caution.

Reasons for changes in accounting policies and situations of correction of accounting errors: 
The Ministry of Finance issued the Interpretation No. 16 of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises 
(the ""Interpretation No. 16"") on November 30, 2022. The scope of the initial recognition exemption for 
deferred income tax in the Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 18-Income Tax was revised. 
Making it clear that the provisions on exemption of initial recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and 
deferred income tax assets in Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 18-Income Taxes shall not 
be applied if a single transaction is not a business combination, that affects neither accounting profit nor 
taxable income (or deductible loss) when the transaction occurs, and that initially recognized assets and 
liabilities result in equal taxable temporary differences and deductible temporary differences. This provision 
is effective as of January 1, 2023 and may be implemented in advance. The Group implemented this 
requirement from January 1, 2023, adopted the retrospective adjustment method for accounting treatment, 
and restated the financial statements for the comparative period.

Section III Management Discussion and Analysis 
I. The Industry Situation and Main Business of the Company during the Reporting Period 
1. Business Overview 
With the rapid development of AI, big data, and IoT technologies, digitalization has accelerated its penetration 
into various industries and fields, creating new industries and business models, and giving birth to a group of digital-
era giants in retail, media, entertainment, local life, and other fields. Major countries around the world have 
introduced strategies and plans to promote the accelerated application of digital technologies. In 2016, the Chinese 
government proposed to promote the deep integration of information technology and economic and social 
development, and, for the first time, introduced the concept of ""Digital China"" in the Outline of the 13th Five-Year 
Plan for National Economic and Social Development. In 2021, ""Digital China"" was identified as one of the 
important national strategies in the 14th Five-Year Plan and 2035 Vision Goals of China. 
As digitization and digital transformation continue to unfold, data has become a new production factor. A vast 
majority of companies built around the physical world (which can be referred to as non-digital native companies), 
especially manufacturing companies, have conducted a large amount of IT work, but the lack of core data required 
for digital transformation of their core business processes and the data-based products and solutions for intelligent 
control and decision-making remains the biggest pain point for these companies. 
The digitization of physical world scenarios is the fundamental unit of digital transformation. ""Signals"" are 
widely present in the physical world and a variety of perceptual capabilities are needed to collect multi-dimensional 
and multi-type data and enable them to be mapped in the digital world. The demand for digital transformation is 
personalized and highly fragmented. Different industries and even different participants within the same industry 
vary in their demands for digital transformation. Only by deeply integrating technology and user needs can we truly 
solve the digital transformation problems in specific scenarios and empower business with digital technology. 
Hikvision's comprehensive perception capabilities facilitate acquisition of richer data. By focusing on 
video perception, Hikvision has built a comprehensive perception system that encompasses electromagnetic waves 
such as visible light, infrared, radar, and X-ray, mechanical waves such as sound waves and ultrasound, as well as 
various physical sensing technologies. At present, the Company has tens of thousands of IoT perception products, 
covering multiple categories including front-end cameras, audios and sensors, enabling comprehensive aggregation
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
17 
of images, sound, vibration, temperature, and other multi-dimensional data. 
Hikvision's diverse digital technology further unlocks data value. With our profound expertise in cloud 
computing, big data and AI as well as deep understanding of AIoT, the Company has launched a capability 
architecture ""integrating cloud and edge, IoT and information network, digitalization and intelligence"". Meanwhile, 
the Company continues to improve our data processing and analysis capabilities by increasing investment and 
accumulation in basic computing power and large model construction. Recently, we have innovatively launched the 
Guanlan large model that promotes the wider value fulfilment of AI. 
Hikvision leverages a deep understanding of the industry to meet the application needs of personalized 
scenarios. Currently, the Company has covered over 500 segmented scenarios in nearly 90 sub-industries across 
over 10 main industries, and continues to expand our presence in many fields related to production, life, and social 
governance. With the establishment of lower-level distribution channels and long-term communication and

measure the temperature at various positions along the direction of fiber laying and locate points with abnormal 
temperatures. A host covers tens of kilometers, achieving sub-meter level fault location and maintaining the health 
of cables, belts, and other equipment. In addition to the 10/20/30 km general model, the specialized intrinsic safety 
model is used for fire temperature measurement of belts and power cables in coal mines where heavy equipment 
transportation is inconvenient. The 2.5 km economical short-distance optical fiber for temperature measurement is 
more suitable for scenarios such as energy storage cabinets and distribution cabinets that do not have high distance 
requirements. At the Asian Games Hangzhou, the distributed positioning optical fiber for temperature measurement 
was used for real-time monitoring 7/24, helping to ensure electricity safety during the games.

conditions, helping to maintain a long-term clean water environment. 
Gas monitoring: To address the difficulty in detecting and locating gas leaks in petroleum, chemical, natural 
gas and other industries, Hikvision has launched a series of gas monitoring products that can analyze a single gas 
or hundreds of gases, meeting the needs of various gas monitoring scenarios. For example, our gas cloud imaging 
telemetry device, which operates based on the principle of spectral absorption, can observe the distribution of VOC 
masses in space in real-time. The device solves the problem of monitoring VOC leaks under traditional detection 
modes by making previously invisible VOCs ""visible"". The hyperspectral Fourier gas telemetry instrument uses the 
fingerprint spectrum of gas in different wavelength bands to remotely detect gas clouds, which can detect more than 
490 toxic and harmful gas substances such as methane and ethylene. The device can overlay spectra and RGB 
images to visually display the distribution and diffusion trend of gas concentration. It continuously generates 
sequence diagrams for gas monitoring, and monitors the distribution of gas concentration throughout the day, 
achieving rapid and accurate quantitative analysis of sudden air pollution gases. 
Vegetation monitoring: The multispectral vegetation monitoring instrument collects high-precision spectral 
data on the vegetation in real-time, and quickly converts them into multiple vegetation parameters that provide 
information on vegetation growth status, thus conducting intelligent health checks on the vegetation regardless of

Accidents are sometimes caused by collisions during the operation of large construction machinery such as 
overhead cranes, cranes, gantry cranes, stackers and reclaimers, ship loaders, and scrapers. Obstacle detection has 
always been a top priority for companies in safety production supervision. Mechanical obstacle avoidance is mainly 
divided into three types: obstacle avoidance between large moving machines and people, obstacle avoidance 
between machines, and obstacle avoidance during operations. Hikvision has launched corresponding millimeter 
wave radars for all three scenarios. 
4D obstacle avoidance radars: Installed on mechanical support legs, these radars are mainly used for obstacle 
avoidance between large moving machines and people by detecting obstacles in real-time within 20 meters ahead 
at a horizontal angle of 120 degrees, and a vertical angle of 60 degrees. 
Location radars: These radars are installed in the upper middle area of machinery and mainly used for obstacle 
avoidance between machines in enclosed areas within a detection range of over 500 meters at a horizontal angle of 
60 degrees, and a vertical angle of 20 degrees. These radars effectively solve the problem of poor environmental
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
33 
adaptability caused by the unique path in traditional laser ranging and infrared detection solutions in these scenarios. 
They also have independent emission and reception forms and provide greatly improved anti-interference and 
stability.

production efficiency improvement, helping them with digital transformation. 
Panoramic photoelectric turntable: With regard to the monitoring needs of large scenarios, traditional 
camera solutions have longer inspection times and are difficult to directly generate panoramic images. Our 
panoramic photoelectric turntable features the fast-steering mirror technology that ensures clear imaging without 
trailing during high-speed operation. It scans the target by rotating 360° down to 2.4 s per revolution, and generates 
a visual panoramic splicing image using infrared thermal imaging. A single device is able to quickly control the 
overall situation. The turntable can quickly detect small targets when used with our self-developed small target 
detection algorithm, and can also be connected to a thermal imaging PTZ camera, which allows users to view and 
verify details by zooming in the targets. Additionally, the product provides clear imaging even at night, 
compensating for the disadvantage of visible light. It is widely used in many scenarios such as oil fields, ports, and 
key area boundaries to facilitate high-altitude panoramic protection for companies. 
Thermal imaging-based fire prevention product series: Thermal imaging can be used to quickly locate fire 
sources and warn of flames through temperature sensing. This series of products is designed to meet the indoor and 
outdoor fire protection needs. Taking corporate safety production as an example, these products are used to develop 
a high-precision fire protection system based on thermal imaging applications, which responds quickly to accurately 
detect fire points and prevent potential hazards. These products warn of flames through thermal imaging monitoring
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report

and analyze data with a multi-algorithm engine to reduce false alarms, and make alarms more accurate and alarm 
handling more efficient, minimizing losses, and warning of fire for companies. 
 
Multispectral fire detector series: This series is designed for fire scenarios such as fires in factories, 
warehouses, traffic tunnels, and laboratories. These detectors innovatively integrate spectral technology, thermal 
imaging technology, and AI algorithms. Compared with single fire detection technology, the fusion of several 
technologies allows second-level synchronous identification of temperature, flames, smoke, and other elements, 
thus recognizing fire hazards more accurately and intelligently through multiple verifications. A 0.1 square-meter 
fire panel can detect and locate abnormal temperatures, flames, and smoke within a distance of up to 150 meters, 
helping to detect and handle fire hazards in advance. In addition, these products can provide reliable support for 
decision-making in digital fire protection command and scheduling through dual verification of infrared 
spectroscopy and visual videos. 
Thermal imaging-based ultra-high temperature cameras: Ordinary cameras cannot work properly in high-
temperature operation scenarios. However, with a wide temperature measurement range of 0–1,800 ℃ and a -
20–200 ℃ circulating refrigeration system, our thermal imaging-based ultra-high temperature cameras can meet 
the vast majority of high-temperature production scenarios. Equipped with the self-cleaning technology for 
germanium windows, these cameras allow precise and sensitive temperature detection and presentation of clear 
thermal images even in dusty environments. The devices are widely used in many industries such as steel, 
automotive, liquor, electronic manufacturing, and food, providing real-time monitoring of operational processes to

workpieces, and provide non-destructive defect detection, helping users to efficiently detect defects and improve 
product quality in industrial production scenarios. 
 
To meet the demand for automated quality inspection of components in the manufacturing industry, the 
Company has launched an industrial auscultation microphone series. By collecting voiceprint information of 
machine through bone conduction sensors and comparing them with AI voiceprint models, these microphones can 
detect abnormal noise in the production process of various motors, pumps, and compressors, and intelligently
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
43 
determine whether the sound of the workpiece is normal or abnormal. Traditional quality inspection methods are 
based on manual listening. As workers vary in experience and the parameters are difficult to quantify, it is difficult 
to ensure timeliness and accuracy, and trace the detection process. Our industrial auscultation microphones are able 
to detect abnormal sound without disrupting the original production arrangements. They can be used to inspect each 
workpiece instead of inspecting them randomly, and trace workpiece problems. The quality inspection results can 
be integrated into the MES, making quality inspection more efficient, accurate, and standardized. These products 
can be used for quality inspection of abnormal noise in automotive electric components and household appliance 
motors. 
 
Machine vision, as the core of industrial sensing, is the eye of robots and automation equipment, and is also

In the field of intelligent signal control systems, Hikvision takes advantage of our own products across the 
supply chain to integrate and apply perception data and signal control algorithms, enabling radar-video assisted 
vehicle detectors to accurately collect traffic parameters. Combining the radar-video assisted multi-modal large 
model with millimeter-wave radars and high-definition cameras, the Company has acquired millions of segments 
of radar-video assisted perception, and constructed the radar-video assisted integrated large model that 
simultaneously perceives spatial physical information and semantic image information. This model is capable of 
ultra-long-distance perception and the detection of vehicle flow trajectories with a precision of more than 95%. 
Compared with the vision or single-mode radar models, the radar-video assisted multi-modal large model provides 
a deeper understanding of the physical world by extracting effective information from multi-dimensional signals 
and exploring the potential relationships among different modal information, so that the radar-video assisted 
products can deliver unparalleled performance at day and night and in rainy and foggy environments, and are used 
at a large scale. Meanwhile, in contrast to the traditional radar-video assisted products that have a shorter detection 
distance in the algorithm scheme, our new products featuring the radar-video assisted multi-modal large model are 
two times more powerful in perceiving targets. Hikvision's radar-video assisted all-in-one devices, equipped with 
ultra-long-range radars and multi-lens long and short focus videos, are capable of high-precision detection of ultra-
long-range vehicles and traffic trajectories. With a breakthrough performance in detection distance, these radar-
video assisted fusion products can significantly reduce the construction costs of intelligent signal control systems 
and digital roads, and improve the ability to manage traffic congestion and ensure traffic safety.

development of control algorithms based on traffic knowledge and AI technology, as well as consultation algorithms 
based on traffic knowledge graph and field of view graph technologies. Furthermore, based on the perception data 
from radar-video assisted vehicle detectors, we have implemented an AI-assisted high-order signal timing control 
optimization algorithm. For example, the algorithm can intelligently divide the daily traffic volumes of a particular 
intersection into morning and evening peak hours, off-peak hours, and other time periods based on its historical 
traffic flow, and generate a traffic release plan for each time period that supports dynamic generation. It can also 
accurately predict the next cycle of traffic based on historical traffic and real-time traffic of the day, so as to provide 
more precise solutions in case of sudden changes in traffic volumes (start/end of a peak period). 
The Company continues to enhance comprehensive road management and control capabilities by promoting

Interactive audio products 
Over the course of three years, Hikvision has built independent product R&D capabilities covering all 
processes of the interactive audio field. The Company has developed three product systems: security audio, 
broadcasting audio, and professional audio, leading the audio industry towards an array-based, intelligent networked 
future. We provide pleasant, easily adjustable and manageable system solutions for sound capture and reinforcement 
that are widely used in different scenarios such as conference rooms, lecture halls, venues, and campuses, bringing 
higher quality sound, more comfortable speeches, and smoother communication.
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
63 
Array-based - Precise sound capture and reinforcement bring higher definition quality: As speakers need 
to hold microphones or stand close to desktop microphones in traditional large conferences and other sound capture 
scenarios, the microphones are largely affected by the distance and environment, and likely to produce unstable 
sound quality. Combining multi-beam and algorithm technologies, Hikvision's sound capture array can effectively 
shield noise, suppress interference, and capture sound precisely over long distances across multiple areas. Just one 
of the 128mic ceiling array microphones released by Hikvision can cover a space of 100 square meters, freeing up 
users' hands through seamless sound reinforcement. On the other hand, heterogeneous array square microphones 
increase the sound capture distance while ensuring sound quality and volume, allowing speakers to speak clearly 
and stably without leaning forward. They are suitable for middle- to high-end conference rooms, lecture halls, and 
more. 
With regard to sound reinforcement, multiple individual speakers are installed together in traditional sound 
reinforcement scenarios, which can easily lead to reverberation, uneven listening experience for the front and rear 
listeners, and other problems. Hikvision's source linear array-based sound column uses a combination of multiple 
speaker arrays and a constant beamwidth beamforming algorithm to make the sound field beam adjustable and 
controllable, creating an even sound field for both the front and rear listeners. Moreover, sound waves emitted from 
the column surfaces are more effective in suppressing whistling and have a more stable output. The sound beams 
can accurately reach the target audience, reducing noise and echoes, and producing clearer sound quality. The remote 
sound-field beams are adjustable, eliminating the need for on-site adjustment of the installation angle, making the 
sound column more harmonious with the environment and more aesthetically pleasing. 
Networked - Audio effects are remote adjustable for more convenient management: Unlike networked 
videos, which have brought revolutionary changes to the entire security monitoring industry, networked audios are 
currently in their early days, but represent an inevitable trend. An analog audio system requires a large amount of 
wiring, complicated deployment, and can easily cause interference with sound quality. However, a networked audio 
system connects all audio devices with only one Ethernet cable, allowing for simplified wiring, convenient 
expansion, and extended space, and further improves sound quality by eliminating the need for multiple analog-to-
digital conversions. Hikvision's 8000 series networked professional audio system is entirely networked from sound 
capture to processing and to playback, and transmits audio data in milliseconds by implementing the AES67 
transmission protocol. With the system, different speakers can synchronize in nanoseconds, and capture and enhance 
sound without delay or acoustic differences, producing audio effects that can be conveniently managed through
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
64 
remote online precise adjustment. 
Intelligent - Sound quality is further improved using AI algorithms: With the support of AI algorithms, 
audio products can now be optimized with software algorithms instead of hardware and devices alone, thus 
overcoming hardware bottlenecks, further improving sound quality, and significantly reducing system costs. 
Hikvision's 8000 series networked professional audio system comprehensively utilizes AI in signal processing, 
audio playback, and sound tuning to enhance product capabilities. 
AI-based noise reduction: With hundreds of noise models, the system automatically filters out non-stationary 
noise such as mouse clicks and keyboard typing, as well as stationary noise such as air conditioning and equipment 
sounds in conference scenarios, making the sound quality clearer; 
AI-based sound source localization: The system supports beams in 8 areas, and gives priority to capturing 
the voice of the main speaker if multiple people speak simultaneously. It focuses on the position of the main speaker 
in real-time and automatically shields interference outside the beam area, clearly capturing the sound of the main 
speaker even though he/she walks around; 
AI-based device detection: The system monitors the real-time operation status of equipment and 
automatically triggers alarms in case of abnormal conditions; 
AI-based sound field calibration: The system automatically detects parameters such as echo delay, 
environmental reverberation, and noise reduction level, and enables one-click debugging by automatically adjusting 
to the optimal configuration parameters. 
After continuous efforts, Hikvision has improved our capabilities in independent R&D of audio products. The 
Company has a professional acoustic product R&D team and several automated assembly, testing, and packaging

a competitive driver of Hikvision's technological innovation. 
Demands in the AIoT industry has always been fragmented and scenario-based. How to meet personalized 
demands and create scenario-based solutions while maximizing business economies of scale is a challenge that is 
faced by all industry participants. Hikvision has established and consistently improved the operating mechanism 
and organizational systems to adapt to the fragmented demands, and has continuously promoted the refinement and 
optimization of baseline products and standardized business services while meeting personalized demands. 
Digital transformation has exerted a profound impact on retail, media, entertainment, local life and other sectors, 
and created a group of giants in the digital era. As digital transformation advances, the demand for quality and 
efficiency improvement and costs reduction has become increasingly prominent in traditional industries. 
Digitization is a primary way to meet these needs. With strong technological expertise and profound industry 
understanding, Hikvision is rapidly expanding digital transformation business services.

further expand the proportion of corporate business services in our business structure. 
2. 
Continuously improving domestic and foreign marketing networks and gaining insight into customer 
needs 
The Company is committed to building a comprehensive marketing system covering the world that quickly 
responds to customer needs. In China, the Company has developed a city-centered marketing network. As of 2023, 
the Company has established 32 provincial-level business centers, and more than 300 city-level branches and offices 
under the business centers, forming a hierarchical city-based marketing system. At the same time, the Company has 
expanded industry scenario applications for domestic business services by differentiating users into public business 
groups, enterprise business groups, and small and medium-sized enterprises business groups. Overseas, the 
Company has continuously promoted the process of localization and implemented the strategy of ""one policy for 
one country"". As of 2023, we have set up 80 branches, subsidiaries and offices in the international market including

to customer needs. 
3. 
Continuously building a flexible manufacturing system to enhance supply chain stability 
The AIoT market is fragmented due to the diversity and personalization of AIoT products. On the production 
end, this market characteristic is manifested as the formation of large-scale customized manufacturing needs of 
multiple small-lot orders. As an answer to this challenge, Hikvision has focused on continuously building a flexible

III. Core Business Analysis 
1. Overview 
The concentrated outbreak of social demand during a certain period often accompanies the rise of a group of 
enterprises. Looking back at the past two decades, Hikvision has taken advantage of the demand for social security 
improvement and become a leading global security enterprise. Looking towards the future, the continuous 
improvement of production efficiency is the key to enhancing competitiveness. As a traditional manufacturing 
power, China considers enhancing the competitiveness of manufacturing enterprises as a top priority. Hikvision 
continues to pave the way for business transformation by shifting our business positioning from security to AIoT, 
aiming to fully apply AIoT technologies and products to all aspects of social life, thoroughly solve users' core pain 
points from the dimensions of quality improvement, efficiency enhancement, and cost reduction, and help users 
create more value. 
In recent years, the global economy and politics have suffered from severe external turmoil such as anti-
globalization, public health event, inflation, and regional military conflicts. If Hikvision were a moving truck, 
strategic transformation would be like replacing the engine of the moving truck, which was made even more difficult 
by the exceptionally bumpy roads. Nevertheless, in 2023, Hikvision preliminarily completed the transformation of 
our AIoT strategy, recording a total operating revenue of RMB 89.34 billion with a year-on-year increase of 7.42%, 
and a net profit attributable to shareholders of the Company of RMB 14.11 billion with a year-on-year increase of 
9.89%. We will continue to invest in research, production, and sales, firmly believing in stable and long-term 
development. 
1. Sustained investment in R&D to consolidate the innovation foundation for business transformation. After 
more than a decade of development, Hikvision has accumulated significant expertise in multidimensional perception 
and sensory fusion technologies, with a well-established scale in the research and development and application of 
artificial intelligence. Sustained investment in AI has substantially improved our development of products, 
algorithms and solutions. The iterative evolution of numerous technology sets has brought favorable clustering 
effects to Hikvision's product development in terms of technology combination and aggregation. On the basis of 
these efforts, Hikvision has rapidly promoted the innovation and R&D of digital products. In 2023, the Company 
launched a large number of new products with vastly different functions and forms to adapt to new scenarios and 
needs, laying the foundation for the implementation of our AIoT strategy.
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
126 
2. Continuous organizational change towards business objectives. In terms of the marketing, Hikvision has 
established a unique marketing strategy with a focus on market expansion into lower-tier regions. The Company 
has set up provincial-level business centers and city-level branches in China and implemented the strategy of ""one 
policy for one country"" overseas to foster lower-level business organizations, making marketing activities closer to 
users and responding quickly to their needs. In addition, Hikvision has promoted organizational change driven by 
vertical industries to meet the business needs of industries represented by headquarters, branches, and chain 
enterprises. Our marketing organizations have become more flexible and adaptable to the business environment. 
Furthermore, guided by the business differentiation strategy, the Company has focused on key business services by 
splitting our product lines, industry lines, and innovative business services. We have promoted moderate 
independent operation and assessment, and continuously expanded and strengthened small product and industry 
categories, facilitating organizational development towards business changes. 
3. Continuously improving the flexibility of the supply chain and optimizing manufacturing costs. Compared 
to the highly automated and scaled production lines of a single product category, the demand for multiple small 
batches of multiple product categories has posed an enormous challenge to the production lines. Hikvision has long 
been committed to building a flexible and efficient manufacturing system that continuously improves our 
manufacturing capabilities by promoting factory automation and R&D automation, and using AI technology. Only 
by solving the manufacturing problems can fragmented market demands be met quickly and with high quality. In 
2023, Hikvision vigorously promoted the development of digital products for production parks by verifying our 
own ideas through practice. By promoting innovative applications of automated, digital, and intelligent technologies 
and products, we aim to improve supply quality, increase operational efficiency, and reduce production costs. 
4. Expanding a presence in AIoT and strengthening innovative business services. In 2023, the Company's total 
revenue from innovative business services was RMB 18.55 billion, accounting for 20.77% of our overall revenue. 
EZVIZ Network, which was listed on the Science and Technology Innovation Board in 2022, has become one of 
the few AIoT companies in the industry with complete vertical integration service capabilities, ranging from 
hardware design, R&D, manufacturing to IoT cloud platforms. By focusing on industrial IoT, smart logistics, and 
intelligent manufacturing, HikRobot has continuously invested in mobile robots and machine vision, and has 
become a domestic leader in the two fields. It has submitted an IPO application to the SZSE ChiNext Market. Our 
other innovative business services are in a period of rapid development, and their market competitiveness continues 
to improve. Centralized or decentralized operations are performed for these business services to support the 
Company's sustained and stable business growth, helping the Company achieve stable, long-term success.
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
127 
The trend of digital transformation has arrived, and AIoT is Hikvision's choice of the times. In 2023, we will 
stick to our strategic positioning, firmly promote the Company's business transformation, and make positive 
progress in the fields of technology system, product system, manufacturing system, marketing system, and 
innovative business group, taking a solid step on the Company's strategic transformation and laying a good 
foundation for steady progress in the future on the road of AIoT. The company will continue to consolidate the 
technical foundation, enrich the product matrix, innovate intelligent applications, contribute to the digital 
transformation of various fields of economy and society, and create tangible value for users.

3. Key Matters 
Key matters are matters we deem the most significant to the financial statements audit for the current period based 
on our professional judgment. These matters are handled based on the financial statements audit as a whole and the audit 
opinion formed accordingly. We don’t present opinions separately on these matters. We confirm that the following matters 
are key matters to be communicated through in the audit report.
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
226 
1) 
Recognition of Sales Revenues 
 
Description: 
As shown in Note (V) 46, the operating revenue in the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year 
ended December 31, 2023 is RMB89,339,856,855.68. The product sales revenue, a key performance indicator, reaches 
RMB84,971,000,242.56, accounting for 95.11% of the operating revenue, which is a significant indicator of the Group 
and has a significant influence on results of business operations. The product sales revenue include different sales models 
such as product domestic sales and product export sales by domestic companies and the overseas sales of overseas 
subsidiaries, and the revenue recognition is complicated. Therefore, we regard the occurrence of product sales revenue as 
a key audit matter. 
 
Audit Measures: 
Main audit procedures that we perform for the aforesaid key audit matters include: 
(1) Understanding and evaluating design and implementation of key internal control in relation to revenue recognition, 
and testing the effectiveness of its operation; 
(2) For revenues under different sales models, selecting a sample to check the sales contract, reviewing its main 
transaction terms, evaluating whether revenue recognition complies with requirements of accounting policies of the 
Group and the Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises;  
(3) Analyzing revenues and gross profits based on product types, to understand whether there are abnormal fluctuations 
in the revenues and gross profits for the year, and conducting a test of details for identified specific transactions, 
through systematic analysis of revenue data, and reviewing relevant supporting documents; 
(4) Selecting sample(s) from product sales revenues recorded for the year, checking invoices, sales contracts or orders, 
shipping orders, signature forms, and other supporting documents; for the sample(s) of income under the export model 
of the selected domestic companies, additional inspections will be made to the customs declaration record and 
shipment record. 
 
2) 
Provision for Credit Loss of Accounts Receivable 
Description: 
As disclosed in Note (V) 4 to the consolidated financial statements of the Group, as of December 31, 2023, the balance 
of accounts receivable amounted to RMB39,006,606,967.83, and the balance of provision for credit losses of accounts 
receivable amounted to RMB3,191,433,456.39. The book value of the Group’s accounts receivable is relatively high, and 
the provision for credit loss of accounts receivable has a significant impact on the financial statements. As shown in Note 
(III) 11.2, Note (III) 13 and Note (III) 34 of the financial statements, the Group makes provisions for credit losses for 
accounts receivable at an amount equivalent to expected credit losses during the entire duration. For accounts receivable 
with significant individual amount and when the debtor has major financial difficulties, etc., the Group recognizes its credit 
losses based on individual assets, and classifies other accounts receivable into different combinations based on common 
credit risk characteristics and calculates expected credit losses on a portfolio basis. 
For accounts receivable classified into portfolios, the Group uses impairment matrix to determine the expected credit 
loss provision for accounts receivable. The expected credit loss provision ratio for each portfolio is determined based on 
the Group’s historical overdue ratio and default and with reference to the forward-looking information of the industry. The
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
227 
accounting estimates above are subject to a high level of uncertainties. Therefore, we identify the recognition of credit loss 
provision for accounts receivable on a portfolio basis as a key audit matter. 
 
Audit Measures: 
Main audit procedures that we perform for the aforesaid key audit matters include: 
(1) Understanding and evaluating design and implementation of key internal control in relation to expected credit loss 
provision for accounts receivable by the Group, and testing the effectiveness of its operation; 
(2) Understanding the Group’s accounting policies for expected credit loss on accounts receivable; for the model credit 
loss provision for accounts receivable on a portfolio basis, the following main procedures were performed 
-Assessing the rationality of measurement method by using impairment matrix model, and the rationality of the key 
parameters and assumptions used in the impairment matrix model, including classification of different portfolios, 
classification of stage, forward-looking adjustment, etc.; 
- Obtaining the historical default data used by the Group’s management in determining the historical loss rate of 
accounts receivable, and evaluating the accuracy thereof; 
- Selecting samples to test the accuracy of the classification of portfolio and stage by the Group’s management; 
- Recalculating the expected credit loss provision based on default loss percentage.

The governance is responsible for supervising financial reporting processes of Hikvision.

6. Responsibility of Certified Public Accountants on Audit of the Financial Statements 
Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the overall financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue audit report that contain audit opinions. Reasonable assurance is 
a high level of assurance, but could not guarantee that an audit performed in accordance with the Auditing Standards can 
always figure out any existing material misstatements. Misstatements may be caused by fraud or error. Misstatement is 
generally considered to be material if it is reasonably expected that the misstatement, alone or aggregated, may affect the 
users’ financial decisions based on the financial statements. 
In performing the audit in accordance with the Auditing Standards, we applied professional judgment and maintained 
professional skepticism. Meanwhile, we also perform the following duties:  
(1) Identify and evaluate the risk of material misstatement of financial statements due to fraud or error; design and 
implement audit procedures to cope with these risks, and obtain adequate and appropriate audit evidence as the basis 
for expressing audit opinions. As fraud may involve collusion, forgery, willful omission, misrepresentation or 
override of internal control, the risk of not discovering a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of 
not discovering a material misstatement due to error. 
(2) Understand the internal control related to auditing as a way to design appropriate audit procedures.  
(3) Evaluate the properness of accounting policy selected by the management and the rationality of accounting estimate 
and related disclosure. 
(4) Reach a conclusion on whether the going concern assumption adopted by the management is appropriate. Meanwhile, 
based on the audit evidence obtained, reach a conclusion on whether there are material uncertainties in the events or 
conditions that may cast significant doubts on Hikvision's ability to continue as a going concern. If we reach a 
conclusion that there is a material uncertainty, the Auditing Standards require us to call the attention of the users of 
the report to the relevant disclosures in the financial statements in the audit report. If the disclosure is insufficient, we 
should issue modified audit opinions. Our conclusion is based on the information available up to the date of the audit 
report. However, future events or conditions may result in the failure of Hikvision to continue as a going concern. 
(5) Evaluate the overall presentation (including the disclosure), structure and content of the financial statements and 
evaluate whether the financial statements fairly reflect the related transactions and events. 
(6) Obtain adequate and appropriate audit evidence on the financial information of entity or business activities of 
Hikvision so as to express audit opinions on the financial statements. We are responsible for directing, supervising 
and executing the audit on the Group, and assume full responsibility for the audit opinions. 
We communicated with the governance about the scope of the audit, the schedule and major audit findings, including 
the notable shortcomings of internal control identified during the auditing.  
We also provide statement to the governance on the independence-related work ethics we follow, and communicate 
with the governance on all relations and other matters that might be reasonably deemed to influence our independence as 
well as relevant precautionary measures (as applicable).  
We determine which of the matters we communicated with the governance are of the greatest importance to the audit 
of financial statements of the current period so as to make them key matters. We describe the matters in the audit report. 
We decide not to communicate on such matters in the audit report unless the laws and regulations forbid the public 
disclosure of such matters, or, in rare circumstances, if the negative consequence of communication of matters in the audit 
report is reasonably expected to exceed the benefit of the public interest.

Bookkeeping base and valuation principles  
The Group measures the accounting elements in accordance with the accrual accounting basis. Except certain financial

of historical costs. If the asset decreases in value, the provision for impairment of assets should be made according to 
relevant regulations.
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
243 
According to the historical cost measurement, the assets shall be measured as per the amount of cash or cash equivalent 
paid at the time of purchase, or the fair value of consideration paid for the purchase of such assets. The liabilities shall be 
measured in accordance with the amount of funds or assets actually received when undertaking current obligations, or the 
contract amount when undertaking the current obligations, or the amount of cash or cash equivalents required for paying 
back the debts in daily activities.  
 
The fair value is a price received by the market participants from selling asset or transferring liability during orderly 
transaction at the measurement date. No matter the fair value is observable or estimated by using valuation technique, the 
measured and disclosed fair value in the financial statement shall be determined on this basis.  
 
When measuring non-financial assets at fair value, the assets shall be measured considering the ability of market 
participants to use the assets for optimal use to generate economic benefits, or to sell the assets to other market participants 
to use the assets for optimal use to generate economic benefits. 
 
For the financial assets measured with transaction price at the initial recognition, and the use of valuation techniques 
involving unobservable inputs in the subsequent fair value measurement, the valuation technique is corrected in the 
valuation process in order to make the initial recognition results confirmed by valuation techniques equal to the transaction 
price. 
 
Based on the observable extent of the input value of the fair value, and the importance of such input value to the fair value 
measurement, the fair value measurement is divided into three levels:  
• Level 1: The input value is the unadjusted offer of the same assets or liabilities on active market acquired on measurement 
date;  
• Level 2: The input value is the input value of relevant assets or liabilities observable directly or indirectly in addition to 
level 1 input value;  
• Level 3: The input value is the non-observable input value of relevant assets or liabilities.

6. The Accounting Treatment of Business Combinations Involving Enterprises under Common Control and 
Business Combinations Not Involving Enterprises under Common Control 
Business combinations are classified into business combinations involving enterprises under common control and business 
combinations not involving enterprises under common control. 
 
6.1 Business combinations involving enterprises under common control 
 
A business combination involving enterprises under common control is a business combination in which all of the 
combining enterprises are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the combination, and 
that control is not transitory. 
 
Assets and liabilities obtained shall be measured at their respective carrying amounts as recorded by the combining entities 
at the date of the combination. The difference between the carrying amount of the net assets obtained and the carrying 
amount of the consideration paid for the combination is adjusted to the share premium in capital reserve. If the share 
premium is not sufficient to absorb the difference, any excess shall be adjusted against retained earnings. 
 
Costs that are directly attributable to the combination are charged to profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
 
6.2 Business combinations not involving enterprises under common control and goodwill 
 
A business combination not involving enterprises under common control is a business combination in which all of the 
combining enterprises are not ultimately controlled by the same party or parties before and after the combination. 
 
The cost of combination is the aggregate of the fair values, at the acquisition date, of the assets given, liabilities incurred 
or assumed, and equity securities issued by the acquirer in exchange for control of the acquiree. If a business combination 
not under the common control is realized step by step through multiple transactions, the cost of the combination is the sum 
of the consideration paid on the purchase date and the fair value of the equity of the purchase already held before the 
purchase date on the purchase date. The intermediary expenses incurred by the acquirer in respect of auditing, legal 
services, valuation and consultancy services, etc. and other associated administrative expenses attributable to the business 
combination are recognized in profit or loss when they are incurred. 
 
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, acquired by the acquirer in a business combination, 
that meet the recognition criteria shall be measured at fair value at the acquisition date.
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
246 
 
Where the cost of combination exceeds the acquirer’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, the 
difference is treated as an asset and recognized as goodwill, which is measured at cost on initial recognition. Where the 
cost of combination is less than the acquirer’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, the acquirer 
firstly reassesses the measurement of the fair values of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities 
and measurement of the cost of combination. If after that reassessment, the cost of combination is still less than the 
acquirer’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets, the acquirer recognizes the remaining difference 
immediately into profit or loss for the current period. 
 
Goodwill arising on a business combination is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, and is presented 
separately in the consolidated financial statements.  
 
7. Criteria for determining control right and Preparation Method of Consolidated Financial Statements 
7.1 Criteria for determining control right 
 
Control right means that an investor may control an investee; the investor may participate in relevant activities of the 
investee to obtain variable rewards and also be able to use the control rights for the investee to influence its amount of 
returns. The Group will re-evaluate, if the change of the relevant facts and circumstances leading to the change of the 
relevant elements involved in the above definition of control.  
 
7.2 Preparation method of consolidated financial statements  
 
The scope of consolidated financial statements shall be confirmed based on the control. 
 
The merger of subsidiary starts from the Group obtaining the control power of the subsidiary, and terminates when the 
Group loses the control power of the subsidiary.  
 
As for subsidiaries disposed by the Group, operating results and cash flows prior to the disposal date (the date of losing 
control right) have been properly included in the consolidated profit statement and consolidated cash flow statement.  
For a subsidiary acquired through a business combination not involving enterprises under common control, the operating 
results and cash flows from the acquisition date (the date when control is obtained) are included in the consolidated income 
statement and consolidated statement of cash flows.
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
247 
No matter when the business combination occurs in the reporting period, subsidiaries acquired through a business 
combination involving enterprises under common control are included in the Group's scope of consolidation as if they had 
been included in the scope of consolidation from the date when they first came under the common control of the ultimate 
controlling party. Their operating results and cash flows from the beginning of the earliest reporting period are included 
in the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of cash flows, as appropriate. 
 
The significant accounting policies and accounting periods adopted by the subsidiaries are determined based on the 
uniform accounting policies and accounting periods set out by the Company. 
 
All significant intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation. 
 
The portion of subsidiaries' equity that is not attributable to the Company is treated as minority interests and presented as 
""minority equity"" in the consolidated balance sheet. The portion of net profits or losses of subsidiaries for the period 
attributable to minority interests is presented as ""minority interests"" in the consolidated income statement below the ""net 
profit"" line item. 
 
When the amount of loss for the period attributable to the minority shareholders of a subsidiary exceeds the minority 
shareholders' portion of the opening balance of owners' equity of the subsidiary, the excess amount are still allocated 
against minority interests. 
 
Acquisition of minority interests or disposal of interest in a subsidiary that does not result in the loss of control over the 
subsidiary is accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the total owners' equity attributable to owner 
of the Company and minority equity are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. The 
difference between the amount by which the minority interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or 
received is adjusted to capital reserve under owners' equity. If the capital reserve is not sufficient to absorb the difference, 
the excess is adjusted against retained earnings. 
 
In the case that the equity of the acquiree is obtained through multiple deals in stages to finally form the business 
combination not under the common control, the business combination shall be handled differently based on whether it is 
""package deal"": where it is package deal, the Company accounts each deal as a deal to obtain the control. If the deal is not 
a ""package deal"", a deal where the control is obtained on the acquisition date will be subject to accounting. The acquiree's 
equity held before the acquisition date will be re-measured based on the fair value of the equity on the acquisition date 
and the difference between the fair value and book value will be included in the profit or loss in the current period. If the 
acquiree's equity held before the acquisition date involves any changes in the other comprehensive income or in any other

For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
248 
owner's equity accounted by the equity method, then it is transferred to income for the period in which it belongs at the 
date of purchase. 
8. Joint Arrangement Classification and Joint Operation Accounting 
Joint arrangements include joint operation and joint ventures. Such classification is defined based on the rights and 
obligations of the joint parties in the joint arrangement, taking into account the structure and legal form of such 
arrangement and also the contractual provisions.  
 
The Groups investment in any joint venture is accounted by the equity method. See the details in Note (III) ""15.3.2 Long-
term equity investment accounted under the equity method"".  
 
9. Recognition Criteria of Cash and Cash Equivalents 
Cash comprises cash on hand and deposits that can be readily withdrawn on demand. Cash equivalents are the Group's 
short-term (Generally refers to due within three months from the purchase date), highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
10. Conversion of Transactions and Financial Statements Denominated in Foreign Currencies.  
10.1 Transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
 
A foreign currency transaction is recorded, on initial recognition, by applying an exchange rate that approximates the 
actual spot exchange rate on the date of transaction; The exchange rate that approximates the actual spot exchange rate on 
the date of transaction is calculated according to the middle price of market exchange rate at the beginning of the month 
in which the transaction happened. 
 
At the balance sheet date, foreign currency monetary items are translated into [RMB] using the spot exchange rates at the 
balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising from the differences between the spot exchange rates prevailing at the 
balance sheet date and those on initial recognition or at the previous balance sheet date are recognized in profit or loss for 
the period, except for exchange differences related to a specific-purpose borrowing denominated in foreign currency that 
qualify for capitalization are capitalized as part of the cost of the qualifying asset during the capitalization period. 
 
When the consolidated financial statements include foreign operation(s), if there is foreign currency monetary item 
constituting a net investment in a foreign operation, exchange difference arising from changes in exchange rates are
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
249 
recognized as ""exchange differences arising on conversion of financial statements denominated in foreign currencies "" in 
other comprehensive income, and in profit and loss for the period upon disposal of the foreign operation. 
 
Foreign currency non-monetary items measured at historical cost are converted to the amounts in functional currency at 
the spot exchange rates on the dates of the transactions.  
 
10.2 Conversion of financial statements denominated in foreign currencies 
 
For the purpose of preparing the consolidated financial statements, financial statements of a foreign operation are 
converted from the foreign currency into RMB using the following method: assets and liabilities on the balance sheet are 
translated at the spot exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date; shareholders' equity items are converted at the 
spot exchange rates at the dates on which such items arose; all items in the income statement as well as items reflecting 
the distribution of profits are translated at exchange rates that approximate the actual spot exchange rates on the dates of 
the transactions; The difference between the converted assets and the aggregate of liabilities and shareholders' equity items 
is recognized into other comprehensive income and shareholders’ equity. 
 
The foreign currency cash flows and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries adopt the exchange rate similar to the spot rate at 
the date of cash flows for conversion. The affected amount of cash and cash equivalents due to the change of exchange 
rate, as an adjustment item, shall be separately listed as ""the impact of cash and cash equivalents due to the change of 
exchange rate"" in the cash flow statement.  
 
The closing balances of the prior year and the actual amount of the prior year are presented at the converted amounts of 
the prior year's financial statements. 
 
On disposal of the Group's entire interest in a foreign operation, or upon a loss of control over a foreign operation due to 
disposal of certain interest in it or other reasons, the Group transfers the accumulated exchange differences arising on 
conversion of financial statements of this foreign operation attributable to the owners' equity of the Company and presented 
under shareholders' equity, to profit or loss in the period in which the disposal occurs. 
 
In case of a disposal or other reason that does not result in the Group losing control over a foreign operation, but only a 
decrease in proportion of overseas business interests, the proportionate share of accumulated exchange differences arising 
on conversion of financial statements are re-attributed to minority interests and are not recognized in profit and loss under 
current period. For partial disposals of equity interests in foreign operations, which are associates or joint ventures, the 
proportionate shares of the accumulated exchange differences arising on conversion of financial statements of foreign 
operations is reclassified to profit or loss under current period.

11. Financial Instruments 
The Group recognizes a financial asset or a financial liability when it becomes a party to a contract of financial instrument. 
 
For the purchase or sale of a financial asset in conventional manner, the asset to be received and the liability to be assumed 
will be recognized on the trading day, or the asset sold will be derecognized on the trading day. 
 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are measured by fair value upon initial recognition (The method of determining 
the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is described in the related disclosure of the basis of accounting 
and valuation principles in note (ii). For financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, the 
relevant trading costs will be directly charged to profit and loss of the current period. For other types of financial assets 
and financial liabilities, the relevant trading costs will be booked into the initial recognition amount. Upon initial 
recognition of accounts receivable which have no material financing components or have not taken into consideration the 
financing components in contracts with a term not exceeding one year according to Accounting Standards for Business 
Enterprise No. 14 – Revenue (""Revenue Standard""), such initial amount is measured by the transaction price as defined 
under the Revenue Standard. 
 
Effective interest rate method refers to the method of calculating the amortized cost of financial asset or financial liability 
and apportioning interest income or interest expenses to each accounting period. 
 
Effective interest rate refers to the interest rate used for discounting the estimated future cash flows of a financial asset or 
a financial liability for an expected subsisting period into the balance of book value of the financial asset or the amortized 
cost of the financial liability. When determining the effective interest rate, the expected cash flows are estimated on the 
basis of considering all contractual terms of the financial asset or financial liability (such as early repayment, extended 
term, call option or other similar option) but without considering the expected credit loss. 
 
The amortized cost of a financial asset or a financial liability refers to the initial recognition amount of such financial asset 
or financial liability, less the repaid amount of principal, plus or minus the accrued amortized amount calculated by 
amortization of the difference between the initial recognition amount and the amount on maturity by using the effective 
interest rate method, and then deducts the accrued provision for losses (only applicable to financial assets). 
 
11.1 Classification, Confirmation and Measurement of Financial Assets
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
251 
After initial recognition, the Group will adopt amortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income, or fair value 
through profit and loss for subsequent measurement depending on different categories of financial assets. 
 
The Group will classify a financial asset into a financial asset measured at amortized cost if the contractual terms of the 
financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal 
amount outstanding and the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets in 
order to collect contractual cash flows. Financial assets classified by the Group as financial asset measured by amortized 
cost include cash and cash equivalents, notes receivables and accounts receivable, other receivables, long-term receivables 
and other non-current assets. 
 
The Group will classify a financial asset into a financial asset measured by fair value through other comprehensive income 
if the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal 
and interest on the principal amount outstanding, and the financial asset is held within a business model whose objective 
is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets. This category of financial assets 
mainly includes financial assets with a maturity of more than one year from the date of acquisition and which are presented 
under other debt investments, financial assets maturing within one year (inclusive) from the balance sheet date and which 
are presented under non-current assets maturing within one year, as well as the notes receivable classified as fair value at 
the time of acquisition and their changes are included in other comprehensive income are listed in the receivables for 
financing, and for those have acquisition period within one year (including one year) are listed in other current assets. 
 
At the time of initial recognition, the Group may, on the basis of a single financial asset, irrevocably designate an 
investment in an equity instrument held for non-trading purpose recognized or without consideration in a business 
combination of enterprises not under the same control as a financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income. 
This type of financial assets is presented as investment in other equity instruments.  
 
Financial assets which have satisfied one of the following conditions indicate that such financial assets are held for trading 
purpose by the Group: 
• 
The purpose of acquiring the relevant financial asset is mainly for sale in recent period. 
• 
At the time of initial recognition, the relevant financial asset is a part of an identifiable portfolio of financial 
instruments under collective management, and there is objective evidence showing a recent and actual existence of short-
term profitable mode.  
• 
The relevant financial assets are derivatives. 
 
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss include financial assets which are classified as financial assets at fair 
value through profit and loss and financial assets designated at fair value through profit and loss:  
• 
Financial assets which do not satisfy the conditions of being classified as financial assets measured at amortized cost 
or as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, they will be classified as financial assets at fair
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
252 
value through profit and loss. 
• 
At the time of initial recognition, in order to eliminate or substantially reduce mismatch in accounting, the Group 
may irrevocably designate a financial asset as a financial asset measured at fair value with changes through profit and loss.  
 
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss will be presented as held-for-trading financial assets. If such financial 
assets have a maturity of more than one year from the balance sheet date (or without a fixed maturity) and which are 
expected to be held for more than one year, they will be presented under other non-current financial assets.  
 
11.1.1 
Financial assets measured at amortized cost 
 
Financial assets measured at amortized cost adopt the effective interest rate method for subsequent measurement according 
to amortized cost, the profit or loss when impairment occurs or upon derecognition will be accounted in profit and loss of 
the current period.  
 
The Group recognizes interest income by using effective interest rate method for financial assets measured at amortized 
cost. The Group determines interest income by multiplying the balance of book value of financial assets with the effective 
interest rate except under the following circumstances: 
• 
For acquired or generated financial assets which incurred credit impairment already, their interest income will be 
determined by using the amortized cost of such financial asset calculated with the credit adjusted effective interest rate.  
• 
For acquired or generated financial assets which have not incurred credit impairment but incur credit impairment in 
the subsequent period, the Group will determine their interest income by using the amortized cost of such financial assets 
multiplied with the effective interest rate in the subsequent period. If such financial asset ceases to have credit impairment 
due to improvement in credit risk in the subsequent period, then the Group should change to multiply the effective interest 
rate with the balance of book value of such financial asset instead to determine the interest income.  
  
11.1.2 
Financial asset at fair value through other comprehensive income 
 
The impairment loss or profit, or interest income calculated by using the effective interest rate method, relating to financial 
asset at fair value through other comprehensive income should be accounted in the profit and loss of the current period, 
and other changes in fair value of such financial assets will be accounted in other comprehensive income. The amount 
charged by such financial asset to the profit and loss of each period is deemed to be equal to the amount which has been 
measured by amortized cost and charged to the profit and loss of each period. Upon derecognition of such financial asset, 
the accumulated profit or loss previously charged to other comprehensive income will be reversed from other 
comprehensive income and charged to profit and loss of the current period.   
 
For non-trading equity instrument investment designated at fair value through other comprehensive income, its changes 
in fair value will be recognized in other comprehensive income. Upon derecognition of such financial asset, the
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
253 
accumulated profit or loss charged to other comprehensive income will be reversed from other comprehensive income and 
charged to retained earnings. During the period when such investment in equity instruments for non-trading purpose are 
held by the Group, the right to receive dividends by the Group has been established, and economic benefits related to 
dividends are likely to flow into the Group, and if the amount of dividends may be measured reliably, the dividend income 
is recognized and accounted in the profit and loss of the current period.  
 
11.1.3 Financial asset at fair value through profit and loss 
 
For financial asset at fair value through profit and loss, subsequent measurement will be calculated at fair value, the profit 
or loss arising from changes in fair value and the dividend and interest income relating to such financial asset will be 
accounted in the profit and loss of the current period.  
 
11.2 Impairment of Financial Assets 
 
For financial assets measured at amortized cost, financial assets that are classified as financial asset at fair value through 
other comprehensive income, lease receivables and contract assets, the Group will handle impairment on the basis of 
expected credit loss and recognize loss provision.  
 
The Group’s consideration of contract assets, notes receivable and accounts receivable that are generated by transactions 
regulated by revenue standards and do not contain significant financing components or that do not consider financing 
components in contracts that are not more than one year old, as well as those lease receivables formed from transactions 
that are defined by the Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 21-Leasing, the loss reserve shall be measured 
based on the amount of the expected credit loss during the entire duration.  
 
For other financial instruments, other than acquired or generated financial assets which have incurred credit impairment 
already, the Group will assess on each balance sheet date the changes in credit risk of the relevant financial instruments 
since initial recognition. If the credit risk of such financial asset has significantly increased after initial recognition, the 
Group will calculate its loss provision based on the amount equivalent to the expected credit loss for the entire subsisting 
period. If the credit risk of such financial asset since initial recognition has not increased significantly, the Group will 
calculate its loss provision according to the expected credit loss amount of such financial asset for the next 12 months. 
The amount of increase or reversal in the provision for credit loss, apart from financial assets classified as financial asset 
at fair value through other comprehensive income, is accounted in the profit and loss of the current period. For financial 
asset classified as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the Group will recognize its credit loss 
provision in other comprehensive income and charged the impairment loss or gain to the profit and loss of the current 
period, and will not decrease the book value of such financial asset presented in the balance sheet.  
 
The Group has calculated the loss provision equivalent to the expected credit loss amount for the entire subsisting period
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
254 
of the financial instrument in the preceding accounting period, but at the balance sheet date of the current period, such 
financial instrument is no longer under the condition of significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the 
Group calculates the loss provision for such financial instrument on the balance sheet date of the current period according 
to an amount equivalent to the expected credit loss for the next 12 months, and the resulting loss provision reversal amount 
will be counted as impairment gain and booked into the profit and loss of the current period.  
  
11.2.1 Significant increase in credit risk 
 
The Group uses available and reasonable forward-looking information with justification, by comparing the default risk of 
the financial instrument at the balance sheet date with the default risk on the initial recognition date, to confirm whether 
the credit risk of the financial instrument has significantly increased after initial recognition. 
 
The Group considers the following factors when assessing whether the credit risk has significantly increased: 
(1) Whether a significant change has been caused to the internal price indicator due to changes in credit risk. 
(2) Whether the external credit rating of financial instrument has actual or expected significant changes. 
(3) Whether the actual or expected internal credit rating of the debtor has been downgraded.  
(4) Whether adverse changes have occurred in the business, finance or economic conditions which are expected to cause 
significant changes in the capability of the debtor to perform debt repayment obligations.  
(5) Whether actual or expected significant changes have occurred in the operating results of the debtor. 
(6) Whether significant adverse changes have occurred in the supervision, economic or technical environment in which 
the debtor operates. 
(7) Whether significant changes have occurred in the value of security pledged for the debt or the quality of guarantee 
or credit enhancement provided by third parties. Such changes are expected to reduce the debtor’s economic 
motivation of repayment according to contractual term or influence the probability of default. 
(8) Whether significant changes have occurred in the economic motivation which will lower the expectation of 
repayment by the borrower according to the contractual term. 
(9) Whether significant changes have occurred in the expected performance and repayment behavior of the debtor. 
 
Whether or not the credit risks increase significantly after the foregoing assessments, if any contractual payment for any 
financial instrument that overdue for over (including) 30 days, it indicates the credit risks of that financial instrument have 
increased significantly. 
 
On the balance sheet date, if the Group determines that the financial instrument only carries low credit risks, then it assumes 
that the credit risks of the financial instrument have not increased significantly since the initial recognition. If the risk of 
default on financial instruments is low, the borrower is highly able to perform its contractual cash flow obligations in the 
short term, and even if the economic situation and operating environment are adversely changed over a long period of time 
but not necessarily reducing the borrower’s performance of its contractual cash obligations, the financial instrument is

Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
255 
considered as having a lower credit risk.  
 
11.2.2  Financial assets which have incurred credit impairment already 
 
When one or more events which will have adverse effect on the expected future cash flows from the financial asset of the 
Group have occurred, such financial asset will become a financial asset which have incurred credit impairment already. 
The evidence of credit impairment occurred in a financial asset includes the following observable information:  
(1) Material financial difficulties have occurred in the issuer or debtor; 
(2) Breach of contract by the debtor, such as default or overdue for the payment of interest or repayment of principal;  
(3) Due to economic or contractual considerations relating to financial difficulties of the debtor, the creditor has granted 
concession to the debtor under no other circumstances;  
(4) The debtor is likely to go bankrupt or carry out other financial restructuring;  
(5) The financial difficulties of the issuer or debtor have caused the disappearance of the active market for the financial 
asset;  
(6) The purchase or generation of a financial asset at a large discount, such discount reflects the fact of occurrence of credit 
loss.  
 
11.2.3  Confirmation of expected credit loss 
 
The Group confirms the expected credit loss of the relevant financial instrument according to the following method: 
• 
In respect of financial asset and lease receivables, the credit loss is the present value of the difference between the 
contractual cash flow that the group should receive and the cash flow that it expects to receive. 
• 
In respect of financial assets with credit impairment on the balance sheet date but they are not acquired or generated 
financial assets with credit impairment, the credit loss represents the difference between the balance of the book value 
of such financial asset and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted by the original effective 
interest rate.  
 
The factors reflected by the method used for calculating expected credit loss of financial instruments by the Group include: 
an unbiased weighted average amount determined by assessing a series of probable outcomes; time value of currency; 
reasonable and justifiable information relating to past events, prevailing conditions and forecast of future economic 
conditions obtained on the balance sheet date without incurring unnecessary additional cost or effort.  
 
11.2.4  Write-off on financial asset 
 
When the Group ceases to have reasonable expectation on the possible collection of all or part of the contractual cash 
flows from the financial asset, the balance of book value of such financial asset will be written off directly. Such a write-
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
256 
off constitutes a derecognition of the relevant financial asset.  
 
11.3 Transfer of financial asset 
 
A financial asset that fulfills one of the following conditions will be de-recognized: (1) termination of contractual rights 
to receive cash flows from the financial asset; (2) upon transfer of such financial asset and transfer of substantially all the 
risks and rewards in respect of the ownership of such financial asset to the transferee; (3) upon transfer of such financial 
asset, though the Group has not transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards in respect of the ownership 
of such financial asset, yet it has not retained the control over such financial asset.   
 
If the Group has not transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards in respect of the ownership of such 
financial asset, and has retained the control over such financial asset, then such transferred financial asset will continue to 
be recognized, and the relevant liabilities will continue to be recognized, according to the level of the Group’s continuous 
involvement in such transferred financial asset. The relevant liabilities will be measured by the Group according to the 
following method:  
• 
If the transferred financial asset is measured by amortized cost, the book value of the relevant liabilities is equivalent 
to the book value of the transferred asset of continuous involvement less the amortized cost of the rights retained by the 
Group (if the Group has retained the relevant rights due to transfer of the financial asset) and plus the amortized cost of 
the obligations undertaken by the Group (if the Group has undertaken the relevant obligations due to transfer of the 
financial asset), and the relevant liabilities are not designated as financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss of 
the current period.  
• 
If the transferred financial asset is measured by fair value, the book value of the relevant liabilities is equivalent to 
the book value of the transferred asset of continuous involvement less the fair value of the rights retained by the Group (if 
the Group has retained the relevant rights due to transfer of the financial asset) and plus the fair value of the obligations 
undertaken by the Group (if the Group has undertaken the relevant obligations due to transfer of the financial asset), and 
the fair value of the rights and obligations shall be measured at the fair value on a separate basis.  
 
For full transfer, which satisfies the conditions of derecognition, of the financial assets, the difference between the sum of 
the book value of the transferred financial assets as at the date of derecognition and the consideration received from such 
transfer and the accumulated amount of change in fair value originally included in other comprehensive income, which 
corresponds to the amount in respect of derecognition, shall be recognized in the profit and loss for the current period. If 
the transfer of the financial assets by the Group is designated as investment in equity instrument held for non-trading 
purpose measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the accumulated gains or losses previously included 
in other comprehensive income shall be transferred out from other comprehensive income and be included in retained 
earnings.  
 
For transfer in part, which satisfies the conditions of derecognition, of the financial assets, the book value of the entire
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
257 
financial assets before the transfer shall be shared between the derecognized portion and the continuous recognition portion 
at their respective relative fair value on the date of transfer, and the difference between the sum of the consideration 
received from derecognition and the accumulated amount of change in fair value originally included in other 
comprehensive income, which corresponds to the amount in respect of derecognition, and the book value of the 
derecognized portion as at the date of derecognition shall be included in the profit and loss of the current period. If the 
transfer of the financial assets by the Group is designated as investment in equity instrument for non-trading purpose 
measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, the accumulated gains or losses previously included in other 
comprehensive income shall be transferred out from other comprehensive income and be included in retained earnings. 
 
For full transfer, which does not satisfy the conditions of derecognition, of the financial assets, the Group will continue to 
recognize the entire financial assets transferred and the consideration received as a result of the asset transfer is recognized 
as a liability when received. 
 
11.4 Classification, confirmation and measurement of financial liabilities and equity instruments  
 
Pursuant to the contractual terms of the issued financial instruments and the substantive economic condition as reflected, 
but not in legal terms only, combined with the definitions of financial liabilities and equity instruments, the Group has 
classified such financial instruments or the components thereof as financial liabilities or equity instruments upon initial 
recognition.  
 
11.4.1 Classification, confirmation and measurement of financial liabilities  
 
Financial liabilities are classified into financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss of the current period and 
other financial liabilities upon initial recognition.  
 
11.4.1.1 Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss of the current period 
 
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss of the current period comprise of financial liabilities held for 
trading purpose (including derivatives of financial liabilities) and financial liabilities designated as measured at fair value 
through profit and loss of the current period. Except for derivatives of financial liabilities, which are presented separately, 
financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss of the current period are presented as financial liabilities held for 
trading.  
 
Financial liabilities that fulfill one of the following conditions suggest that the Group assumes such financial liabilities for 
trading purpose: 
• 
Assumption of the relevant financial liabilities is mainly for the purpose of the recent repurchases. 
• 
The relevant financial liabilities, upon initial recognition, are part of a portfolio of identifiable financial instruments
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
258 
under centralized management, and available objective evidence shows the recent and actual existence of a short-
term profit-making model.  
• 
The relevant financial liabilities are derivatives.  
 
Financial liabilities can be designated, upon initial recognition, by the Group as financial liabilities at fair value through 
profit and loss of the current period, provided that they have satisfied one of the following conditions: (1) such designation 
can eliminate or substantially reduce accounting mismatches; (2) managing and evaluating the performance of portfolios 
of financial liabilities, or portfolios of financial assets and financial liabilities, on fair value basis and reporting internally 
to key personnel of the Group on this basis in accordance with the risk management or investment strategies specified in 
formal written documents of the Group; (3) hybrid contracts, with embedded derivatives, have satisfied the conditions. 
 
Financial liabilities held for trading purpose use fair value for subsequent measurement, gains or losses arise from changes 
in fair value and the dividends or interest expenses relating to such financial liabilities are accounted in the profit and loss 
of the current period. 
 
11.4.1.2  Other financial liabilities 
 
Excluding transfer of financial assets not complying with derecognition conditions, or financial liabilities as a result of 
continuous involvement in transferred financial assets, as well as the financial guarantee contracts, the other financial 
liabilities will be classified as financial liabilities measured at amortized cost, subsequent measurement will be based on 
amortized cost, gains or losses on derecognition or amortization will be accounted in the profit and loss of the current 
period.  
 
If the Group and the counterparty have revised or renegotiated the contract, this has not resulted in the derecognition of 
financial liabilities measured at amortized cost for subsequent measurement, but has caused changes in the contractual 
cash flows, then the Group should recalculate the book value of such financial liabilities, and the relevant gains or losses 
shall be accounted in the profit and loss of the current period. The recalculated book value of such financial liabilities will 
be determined by the Group by discounting the cash flows from the renegotiated or revised contract with the original effect 
interest rate of the financial liabilities. All costs or expenses incurred in the revision or renegotiation of the contract will 
be reflected in the adjusted book value of financial liabilities after such revision, and will be amortized during the 
remaining period of the revised financial liabilities.    
  
 
11.4.2 
Derecognition of financial liabilities 
 
When the existing obligations of a financial liability have been wholly or partially discharged, such financial liability or 
such part of it will be derecognized. When the Group (as borrower) and the lender enter into an agreement to undertake
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
259 
new financial liabilities for replacing the original financial liabilities, if substantive difference exists in the contractual 
terms between the new financial liabilities and the original financial liabilities, the Group should derecognize the original 
financial liabilities while at the same time recognizes the new financial liabilities.  
 
When a financial liability is wholly or partially derecognized, the difference between the book value of the derecognized 
portion and the consideration paid (including non-cash asset transferred out or new financial liabilities undertaken) will 
be accounted in the profit and loss of the current period.  
 
11.4.3 
Equity instrument 
 
Equity instrument refers to a contract which can prove the ownership of remainder interest in assets after deducting all 
liabilities of the Group. The Group issues (including refinances), repurchases, sells or cancels equity instruments for 
treatment of changes in equity. The Group will not recognize changes in the fair value of equity instruments. Trading 
expenses relating to equity transactions will be deducted from equity. 
 
The Group’s distribution to holder of equity instrument is treated as profit distribution, the share dividends paid out will 
not affect the total equity of shareholders.  
 
11.5 Derivatives 
 
Derivatives include foreign exchange forward contract, foreign exchange option contract and interest rate swap contract, 
etc. Derivatives are measured at fair value initially on the date of signing the relevant contract and will be measured at fair 
value for subsequent measurement.  
 
11.6 Offsetting between financial assets and financial liabilities 
 
When the Group has legal right to offset the recognized financial assets and financial liabilities, and such legal right is 
enforceable currently, while at the same time the Group plans to perform netting settlement, or to liquidate the financial 
asset and repay the financial liability at the same time, the amount after offsetting between the financial asset and financial 
liability will be presented in the balance sheet. Save as said above, the financial asset and financial liability are presented 
separately in the balance sheet without offsetting each other.  
 
11.7 Reclassification of financial instruments 
 
When the Group changes its business model for managing financial assets, all affected underlying financial assets will be 
reclassified. All financial liabilities are not reclassified.

The Group reclassifies financial assets and applies the prospective application method for relevant accounting treatment 
from the date of reclassification (i.e., the first day of the first reporting period after the change in the business model that 
led to the reclassification of financial assets). 
 
If the Group reclassifies a financial asset measured at amortized cost to a financial asset at fair value through other 
comprehensive income, it is measured at the fair value of the financial asset at the date of reclassification. The difference 
between the original carrying amount and the fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income. 
12. Notes receivable 
12.1 Method of determining expected credit losses on notes receivable and its accounting treatment 
 
The Group separately assesses the credit risk of the notes receivable with a single significant amount and the debtor with 
severe financial difficulties, and makes provision for credit losses on a portfolio basis for the remaining notes receivable 
based on the credit risk characteristics.The increase or reversal of the provision for expected credit losses of notes 
receivable is recognized in profit or loss as credit impairment gains or losses. 
 
12.2 Combination category and determination basis of bad debt provision according to credit risk characteristics 
 
The Group classifies notes receivable into different portfolios based on the nature of the acceptor. 
 
Portfolio Categories 
Determination basis

13.1 Method of determining expected credit losses on accounts receivable/long-term receivables and their accounting 
treatment 
 
The Group assesses the credit risk of accounts receivable with significant individual amounts and significant financial 
difficulties of debtors and financial lease receivables and installment receivables in long-term receivables individually, 
and determines the credit loss allowance on a portfolio basis using impairment matrix for the remaining parts. The increase 
or reversal of the provision for expected credit losses of accounts receivable is recognized in profit or loss as credit 
impairment gains or losses.

on shared risk characteristics. Common credit risk characteristics adopted by the Group include the geographical location 
and business object. 
 
For long-term receivables, the common credit risk profile adopted by the Group includes business objects. 
 
13.3 Calculation of ageing based on age-based recognition of a portfolio of credit risk characteristics 
 
The Group uses the ageing as a credit risk characteristics, and use impairment matrix to determine the credit losses of its 
accounts receivable and long-term receivables related to the financial lease and installment collection business. The ageing 
is calculated from the end of the credit period. The ageing is calculated on a continuous basis when the terms and conditions 
of accounts receivables and long-term receivables are modified but do not result in derecognition of them. 
 
14. Receivables Financing 
14.1 Method of determining expected credit losses on receivables financing and its accounting treatment 
 
The Group measures bad debt provisions based on expected credit losses over the entire duration, recognizes credit loss 
provisions for receivables financing in other comprehensive income, and recognizes credit impairment losses or gains in 
profit or loss for the period, without reducing the carrying amount of receivables financing presented in the balance sheet. 
 
14.2 Combination category and determination basis of bad debt provision according to credit risk characteristics 
 
The Group considers that there is no significant credit risk for the bank acceptance bills held by the Group, which are all 
bank acceptance bills and the possibility of significant losses due to bank default is low. 
 
15. Other receivables

consumable items and packaging materials 
 
16.1.1 Categories of inventories 
 
The Group's inventory mainly includes finished products, products in process, raw materials and contract performance 
costs. Inventories are initially measured at cost. Cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion 
and other expenditures incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. 
16.1.2 Valuation method of inventories upon delivery 
 
The actual cost of inventories upon delivery is calculated using the moving weighted average method.

16.2 The recognition standard and accounting method of inventory falling price reserves 
 
At the balance sheet date, inventory is measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  When the net realizable 
value is lower than the cost, the inventory falling price reserves is withdrawn. 
 
Net realizable value is the amount of the estimated selling price of inventory in day-to-day activities less the estimated 
costs to be incurred at completion, estimated selling expenses and related taxes. The determination of net realizable 
value of inventories is based on firm evidence obtained, taking into account the purpose for which the inventories are 
held and the effect of events after the balance sheet date. 
 
After the provision for inventory depreciation, if the factors affecting the previous reduction of inventory value have 
disappeared, resulting in the net realizable value of the inventory being higher than its carrying value, the amount of the 
original provision for inventory depreciation shall be reversed, and the amount of the reversal shall be included in the 
current profit or loss. 
 
16.3 The combination category and the basis for determining the inventory falling price reserves, and the basis for 
determining the net realizable value of different categories of inventories 
 
The Group makes provision for inventory falling price reserves by inventory category for inventories with a large 
quantity and low unit price. For inventories manufactured and sold in the same region, having the same or similar use or 
purpose, and difficult to measure separately from other items, provision for inventory depreciation shall be made on a 
consolidated basis. The Group makes provision for inventory falling price reserves according to the nature and status of 
inventories. 
 
17. Contract Assets 
17.1 Method and standard for determination of contract assets 
 
Contract assets refer to the Group’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the Group has transferred 
to a customer when that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. The Group’s unconditional (i.e., 
depending on the passage of time only) right to receive consideration from the customer is separately presented as 
receivables.

17.2 Determination and accounting treatment methods of expected credit loss of contract assets  
 
Consistent with accounts receivable, except for contract assets with significant individual amounts and significant financial 
difficulties of debtors, the Group determines the credit loss for contract assets on a portfolio basis for other contract assets. 
The increase or reversal of expected credit loss provision for contract assets of this year is recognized as impairment loss 
or gain in current profit or loss. 
 
17.3 Combination category and determination basis of bad debt provision according to credit risk characteristics 
Consistent with accounts receivable, the Group provides for credit losses on a portfolio basis based on common risk 
characteristics. Common credit risk characteristics adopted by the Group include the geographical location and business 
object. 
 
18. Long-term Equity Investment 
18.1 Basis for determining joint control and significant influence over investee 
 
Control is the power to govern an entity through participating in relevant activities of the investee; the investor is able to 
obtain variable benefits from its activities, and at same time, to use the control rights on the investee to influence the 
amount of returns. Joint control means that joint control for certain arrangement in accordance with relevant agreements; 
activities relevant to the arrangement cannot be decided until obtaining the unanimous consent of parties sharing control 
right. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is 
not control or joint control over those policies. When determining whether an investing enterprise is able to exercise 
control or significant influence over an investee, the effect of potential voting rights of the investee, such as current 
convertible debts, current executable warrants, etc., held by the investing enterprises or other parties shall be considered. 
 
18.2 Determination of initial investment cost 
 
For a long-term equity, investment acquired through a business combination involving enterprises under common control, 
the shares of merged party's book value of owners' equity in the final controlling party consolidated financial statements 
obtained on the merger date shall be considered as the initial investment cost of long-term equity investment. The 
differences between the initial investment cost of long-term equity investment and the paid cash, the transferred non-cash 
assets and the book value of the assumed debts are adjusted against the capital surplus; if the capital surplus is not sufficient 
to be offset, the remaining balance is adjusted against retained earnings. In the case of issued equity securities treated as 
consolidation consideration, share of book value of owner's equity of merged party in the final controlling party 
consolidated financial statements is regarded as initial investment cost of long-term equity investments on the date of 
consolidation; capital reserve shall be adjusted in accordance with taking total nominal value of issued share as capital
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
265 
share, the difference between the initial investment cost of long-term equity investments and total book value of issued 
shares; In case the capital reserve is not enough for writing down, the retained earnings shall be adjusted.  
 
For a long-term equity investment acquired through business combination not involving enterprises under common control, 
and the merging cost confirmed on the purchased date are regarded as the initial investment cost. In the case that the equity 
of the acquiree is obtained through multiple deals in stages to finally form the business combination not under the common 
control, the business combination shall be handled differently based on whether it is ""package deal"": where it is package 
deal, the Company accounts each deal as a deal to obtain the control. If the deal is not a ""package deal"", the sum of the 
carrying amount of the equity investment of the acquiree plus the cost of the new investment shall be used as the initial 
investment cost of the long-term equity investment calculated according to the cost method. The equity originally held is 
accounted for by the equity method, and the relevant other comprehensive income will not be accounted for the time being. 
 
The intermediate expenses made by the combining party or purchaser for audit, legal service, assessment and other 
management related expenses during the business merger should be included into the current profit and loss as it happens.  
 
Long-term equity investment obtained by other means other than long-term equity investment formed by business 
combination shall be initially measured at cost. 
 
18.3 Subsequent measurement and recognition of profit or loss 
 
18.3.1 Long-term equity investment accounted for using the cost method 
 
Long-term equity investments in subsidiaries are accounted for using the cost method in the Company's financial 
statements. A subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. 
 
The long-term equity investment accounted by the cost method shall be measured at its initial investment cost. If there are 
additional investments or disinvestments, the long-term equity investment cost shall be adjusted. Income from the 
investment in the current period shall be recognized in accordance with the cash dividends or profits declared and issued 
by the investee.  
 
18.3.2 Long-term equity investment accounted for using the equity method

Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
266 
Except for investments in associates and joint ventures that are wholly or partly classified as holding assets for sale, the 
Group accounts for investment in associates and joint ventures using the equity method. An associate is an entity over 
which the Group has significant influence and a joint venture is an entity over which the Group can only exercise joint 
control along with other investors on the investee’s net assets. 
 
Under the equity method, where the initial investment cost of a long-term equity investment exceeds the Group’s share of 
the fair value of the investee’s identifiable net assets at the time of acquisition, no adjustment is made to the initial 
investment cost. Where the initial investment cost is less than the Group’s share of the fair value of the investee’s 
identifiable net assets at the time of acquisition, the difference is recognized in profit or loss for the period, and the cost of 
the long-term equity investment is adjusted accordingly. 
 
Under the equity method, the Group recognizes its share of the net profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the 
investee for the period as investment income or loss and comprehensive income for the period, meanwhile, the book value 
of the long-term equity investment shall be adjusted; The Group shall accordingly reduce the book value of the long-term 
equity investment in terms of the part that shall be enjoyed according to the profit or cash dividends declared by the 
invested unit to be distributed; For other changes in the owners' equity of the invested unit other than net profits and losses, 
other comprehensive incomes and the profit distribution, the book value of long-term equity investment shall be adjusted 
and be included into the capital reserves. The Group shall, on the ground of the fair value of all identifiable assets of the 
invested entity when it obtains the investment, recognize the attributable share of the net profits and losses of the invested 
entity after it adjusts the net profits of the invested entity. If the accounting policies and accounting periods adopted by the 
invested unit are different from those adopted by the Group, the adjustment shall be made for the financial statements of 
the invested unit in accordance with the accounting policies and accounting periods of the Group to recognize the 
investment income and other comprehensive incomes. For the transaction incurred between the group and associated 
enterprises and joint ventures, invested or sold assets don't constitute a business, the part that doesn't achieve internal 
transaction profit or loss or belongs to the Group calculated according to the enjoyed ratio will be offset, and the profit or 
loss on investment will be confirmed on this basis. But for the unrealized loss arising from the internal transaction between 
the Group and the invested unit, if such transaction loss is defined as the impairment loss of the transferred asset, they 
cannot be offset.  
 
When the Group determines the net loss of the invested unit that shall be shared, it is necessary to write-down the book 
value of the long-term equity investment and other long-term equities substantially constituting the net investment of the 
invested unit to zero as a limit. Besides, if the Group is obliged to bear extra loss for the invested unit, it shall be necessary 
to determine provisions and record them to current investment loss in compliance with obligations expected to be assumed. 
If the invested unit realizes any net profits later, the Group shall, after the amount of its attributable share of profits offsets 
its attributable share of the un-confirmed losses, resume recognizing its attributable share of profits.

18.4 Disposal of long-term equity investments 
 
On disposal of a long term equity investment, the difference between the proceeds actually received and the carrying 
amount is recognized in profit or loss for the period. 
 
19. Fixed Assets  
19.1 Recognition criteria for fixed assets 
 
Fixed assets are tangible assets that are held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, for rental to others, 
or for administrative purposes, and have useful lives of more than one accounting year. A fixed asset is recognized only 
when it is probable that economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be 
measured reliably. Fixed assets are initially measured at cost. 
 
Subsequent expenditures incurred for the fixed asset are included in the cost of the fixed asset and if it is probable that 
economic benefits associated with the asset will flow to the Group and the subsequent expenditures can be measured 
reliably. Meanwhile the carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized. Other subsequent expenditures are 
recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred. 
 
19.2 Depreciation of each category of fixed assets 
 
A fixed asset is depreciated over its useful life using the straight-line method since the month subsequent to the one in 
which it is ready for intended use. The depreciation method, depreciation period, estimated residual value rate and annual 
depreciation rate of each category of fixed assets are as follows:

Estimated net residual value of a fixed asset is the estimated amount that the Group would currently obtain from disposal 
of the asset, after deducting the estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition 
expected at the end of its useful life.  
 
19.3 Other explanations 
 
If a fixed asset is upon disposal or no future economic benefits are expected to be generated from its use or disposal, the 
fixed asset is derecognized. When a fixed asset is sold, transferred, retired or damaged, the amount of any proceeds on 
disposal of the asset net of the carrying amount and related taxes is recognized in profit or loss for the period. 
 
The Group reviews the useful life and estimated net residual value of a fixed asset and the depreciation method applied at 
least once at each financial year-end, and account for any change as a change in an accounting estimate. 
 
20. Construction in Process 
Construction in progress is measured at its actual costs. The actual costs include various construction expenditures during 
the construction period, borrowing costs capitalized before it is ready for intended use and other relevant costs. 
Construction in progress is not depreciated. Construction in progress is transferred to a fixed asset when it is ready for 
intended use. The standards and time points for carrying forward various types of projects under construction to fixed 
assets are as follows: 
Item 
Standards and timing of carry-over as fixed assets 
Buildings and Constructions 
The main construction project and supporting projects have been substantially completed and 
reached a state of practical usability. 
Equipments to be installed and 
commissioned 
Relevant equipment and other supporting facilities have been installed; after debugging, the 
equipment can maintain normal and stable operation for a period of time. 
 
21. Borrowing Costs 
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition & construction or production of assets eligible for capitalization 
shall be capitalized when assets expenditure, borrowing costs and necessary construction or production for bringing assets 
to expected conditions for use or marketing have taken place; when construction or production of assets ready for
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
269 
capitalization reach to expected conditions for use or marketing, capitalization shall be ceased. Other borrowing expenses 
are recognized as expenses in the current period.  
 
Where funds are borrowed under a specific-purpose borrowing, the amount of interest to be capitalized is the actual interest 
expense incurred on that borrowing for the period less any bank interest earned from depositing the borrowed funds before 
being used on the asset or any investment income on the temporary investment of those funds. Where funds are borrowed 
under general-purpose borrowings, the Group determines the amount of interest to be capitalized on such borrowings by 
applying a capitalization rate to the weighted average of the excess of cumulative expenditures on the asset over the 
amounts of specific-purpose borrowings. The capitalization rate is the weighted average of the interest rates applicable to 
the general-purpose borrowings. During the capitalization period, exchange differences related to a specific-purpose 
borrowing denominated in foreign currency are all capitalized. Exchange differences in connection with general-purpose 
borrowings are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.  
 
22. Intangible Assets 
22.1 Service life and its basis for determination, estimate, amortization method or review procedure   
 
Intangible assets include land use right, intellectual property (IP), application software, and franchise, etc.  
 
An intangible asset is measured initially at cost. When an intangible asset with a finite useful life is available for use, its 
original cost is amortized over its estimated useful life using the straight-line method. The amortization method, service 
life and net residual value of various intangible assets are shown as follows:

The fees charged by the Group to those who acquire public products and services during the project operation period do 
not constitute an unconditional right to receive cash. When the PPP project assets are ready for their intended use, the 
difference between the consideration amount of the relevant PPP project assets or the amount of confirmed construction 
income and the amount of cash (or other financial assets) that is entitled to receive a determinable amount will be 
recognized as intangible assets.

For an intangible asset with a finite useful life, the Group reviews the useful life and amortization method at the end of the 
year, and makes adjustments when necessary. 
 
For the impairment test of intangible assets, please refer to Note (III), 20. Long-term asset impairment. 
 
22.2 The accounting treatment methods and the collection scope of research and development expenditure  
 
Expenditure during the research phase is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
 
Expenditure during the development phase that meets all of the following conditions at the same time is recognized as 
intangible asset. Expenditure during development phase that does not meet the following conditions is recognized in profit 
or loss for the period.  
(1) It is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale;  
(2) The Group has the intention to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it; 
(3) The Group can demonstrate the ways in which the intangible asset will generate economic benefits, including the 
evidence of the existence of a market for the output of the intangible asset or the intangible asset itself or, if it is to be used 
internally, the usefulness of the intangible asset; 
(4) The availability of adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and the ability to use 
or sell the intangible asset; and 
(5) The expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development phase can be reliably measured. 
 
If the expenditures cannot be distinguished between the research phase and development phase, the Group recognizes all 
of them in profit or loss for the period. The costs of the intangible assets generated by internal development activities only 
include the total expenditure incurred from the time point when the capitalization conditions are available to the point 
when the intangible assets are used for their intended purposes; for the expenditure that already becomes an expenditure 
in the profit and loss statement before the capitalization conditions are available during development of the same intangible 
asset, no adjustment will be made.  
 
The aggregate scope of the Group's R & D expenses includes employee compensation for personnel directly engaged in 
R & D activities, materials and service fees directly consumed by R & D activities, depreciation expenses and amortization 
expenses of intangible assets for equipment and equipment used in R & D activities, rental expenses for R & D sites, 
intermediate testing expenses for R & D activities, new product design expenses, and travel, transportation and

For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
271 
communication expenses required for research and test development. The Group uses the passing of feasibility studies and 
the completion of R&D project projects after evaluation as the specific criteria for classifying R&D projects into research 
and development phases. 
23. Long-term Assets Impairment 
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that the long-term equity investment, fixed 
assets, construction in process, and intangible assets with a finite useful life may be impaired. If there is any indication 
that such assets may be impaired, recoverable amounts are estimated for such assets. Intangible assets with indefinite 
useful life and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually, irrespective of whether there 
is any indication that the assets may be impaired. 
 
Recoverable amount is estimated on individual basis. If it is not practical to estimate the recoverable amount of an 
individual asset, the recoverable amount of the asset group to which the asset belongs will be estimated. The recoverable 
amount is determined by the higher of 1) net amount of fair value of the asset or asset group deducted by the disposal 
expenses; or 2) the present value of the expected future cash flows of the asset or asset group. 
 
If the recoverable amount of an asset or an asset group is less than its carrying amount, the deficit is accounted as an 
impairment provision and is recognized in profit or loss for the period. 
 
Goodwill impairment test shall be conducted at the end of each year at least. Goodwill impairment test shall be conducted 
in accordance with the concerned asset group or asset portfolio. That is to allocate the book value of goodwill to the asset 
group or asset portfolio that is expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination in a reasonable way from the date 
of purchasing. When recoverable amount of apportion-included asset group or asset portfolio of goodwill is less than book 
value of goodwill, impairment loss shall be recognized. Firstly, amount of impairment loss shall be apportioned to the 
book value of goodwill of the said asset group or asset portfolio, and then book value of other assets, except for goodwill, 
in asset group or asset portfolio shall be abated in proportion. 
 
Once the impairment loss of such assets is recognized, it cannot be reversed in any subsequent period.  
 
24. Long-term Deferred Expenses 
 
Long-term deferred expenses are the expenses that are already incurred but will be shared in the current reporting period 
and later periods with amortization term of more than one year, mainly for the expenses on betterment of leased fixed 
assets and employee housing loan deferred interest. Long-term deferred expenses are evenly amortized in installments in 
three to five years during the expected benefit period.

25. Contract Liabilities 
Contract liabilities refer to the obligation of the Group to transfer goods or services to customers for consideration received 
or receivable from customers. Contract assets and contract liabilities under the same contract are presented in net terms. 
 
26. Employee Compensation 
26.1 Accountant Arrangement Method of Short-term Remuneration  
 
During accounting period when the Group's employees provide services, actual short-term remuneration shall be 
recognized as the liabilities and current profit and loss or relevant asset cost. The Group’s employee benefits and welfare 
are included into current profit and loss or relevant asset cost according to actual amount occurred during the period. If 
the employee benefits and welfare is non-monetary, it shall be measured according to its fair value. 
 
During the accounting period that the employees service the Group, the Group pays social insurance premiums such as 
medical insurance premium, industrial injury insurance premium, maternity insurance premium and housing accumulation 
fund for its employees, as well as labor union expenditure and employee education expenses calculated and withdrawn 
according to the regulations, corresponding employee remuneration amount shall be calculated and determined in 
accordance with specified calculation and withdrawal basis and proportion to recognize corresponding liabilities and 
included into the current profit and loss or relevant asset cost.  
 
26.2 Accountant Arrangement Method of Post-employment Benefits  
 
All post-employment benefits shall be considered as the defined contribution plan.  
 
In the accounting period when the employee serves for the Group, the deposited amount calculated based on defined 
contribution plan shall be recognized as liabilities and included in the current profit and loss or relevant asset cost.  
 
26.3 Accountant Arrangement Method of the Termination Benefits 
 
Where the Group provides termination benefits, the employee remuneration liabilities caused by such termination benefits 
will be determined as the following date, whichever is earlier, and will be included in the current profit and loss: 1) When 
the Group cannot unilaterally withdraw the termination benefits provided due to labor relation cancellation plan or

employee lay-off suggestion; or 2）when the Group determines costs or expenses in relation with the restructuring of the 
paid termination benefits.  
 
27. Provisions 
Provisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation related to a contingency such as products quality 
assurance, etc. And it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and the 
amount of the obligation can be measured reliably. 
 
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at 
the balance sheet date, taking into account factors pertaining to a contingency such as the risks, uncertainties and time 
value of money. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision is determined by 
discounting the related future cash outflows. 
 
The Group estimates product quality guarantee deposits based on expected claim rates, maintenance and replacement costs, 
etc. 
 
28. Share-based Payment 
Share-based payment refers to a transaction in which the Group grants the equity instruments or undertakes the equity-
instrument-based liabilities in return for services from employees. The Group's share-based payment is an equity-settled 
share-based payment.  
 
28.1 Equity-settled share-based payments 
 
Equity-settled share-based payments in exchange for services rendered by employees are measured at the fair value of the 
equity instruments granted to employees at the grant date. Such amount is recognized as related costs or expenses on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period, with a corresponding increase in capital reserve. 
 
At each balance sheet date during the vesting period, the Group makes the best estimate according to the subsequent latest 
information of change in the number of employees who are granted with options that may vest, etc. and revises the number 
of equity instruments expected to vest. The effect of the above estimate is recognized as related costs or expenses, with a 
corresponding adjustment to capital reserve.

274 
28.2. Accounting treatment related to implementation, modification and termination of share-based payment arrangement 
 
In case the Group modifies a share-based payment arrangement, if the modification increases the fair value of the equity 
instruments granted, the Group will include the incremental fair value of the equity instruments granted in the measurement 
of the amount recognized for services received. If the modification increases the number of the equity instruments granted, 
the Group will include the fair value of additional equity instruments granted in the measurement of the amount recognized 
for services received. The increase in the fair value of the equity instruments granted is the difference between fair value 
of the equity instruments before and after the modification on the date of the modification. If the Group modifies the terms 
or conditions of the share-based payment arrangement in a manner that reduces the total fair value of the share-based 
payment arrangement, or is not otherwise beneficial to the employee, the Group will continue to account for the services 
received as if that modification had not occurred, other than a cancellation of some or all the equity instruments granted. 
 
If cancellation of the equity instruments granted occurs during the vesting period, the Group will account for the 
cancellation of the equity instruments granted as an acceleration of vesting, and recognize immediately the amount that 
otherwise would have been recognized over the remainder of the vesting period in profit or loss for the period, with a 
corresponding recognition in capital reserve. When the employee or counterparty can choose whether to meet the non-
vesting condition but the condition is not met during the vesting period, the Group treats it as a cancellation of the equity 
instruments granted. 
 
29. Revenue 
The Group's revenue consists of product sales revenue, engineering construction revenue and cloud services and other 
service revenue. 
 
When (or as) a performance obligation in a contract was satisfied, i.e., when (or as) the customer obtains control of relevant 
goods or services, the Group recognizes as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to that performance 
obligation. A performance obligation is the Group’s commitment to transfer to a customer a good or service (or a bundle 
of goods or services) that is distinct, in a contract with the customer.  
 
The Group evaluates the contract on the commencement date of the contract, identifies the individual performance 
obligations contained in the contract and determines whether each individual performance obligation is to be performed 
over a certain period of time or at a certain point in time. Revenue is recognized over time by reference to the progress 
towards complete satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation if one of the following criteria is met: (1) the customer 
simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Group’s performance as the Group performs; (2) the 
Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the customer controls as the Group performs; or (3) the Group’s 
performance does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
275 
payment for performance completed to date. Otherwise, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains 
control of the distinct good or service. 
 
If the contract contains two or more performance obligations, the Group allocates the transaction price to each single 
performance obligation on the contract start date in accordance with the relative proportion of the individual selling price 
of the goods or services promised by each single performance obligation. However, if there is strong evidence that the 
contract discount or variable consideration is only related to one or more (but not all) performance obligations in the 
contract, the Group allocates the contract discount or variable consideration to the relevant one or more performances 
obligation. Individual selling price refers to the price at which the Group sells goods or services to customers separately. 
Where the individual selling price cannot be directly observed, the Group comprehensively considers all relevant 
information that can be reasonably obtained, and uses the observable input value to the maximum to estimate the individual 
selling price. 
 
The Group judges whether the Group’s identity is the principal or agent when engaging in transactions based on whether 
it has control over the goods or services before transferring the goods or services to customers. If the Group is able to 
control the goods or services before transferring them to customers, the Group is the principal responsible person, and 
revenue is recognized based on the total amount of consideration received or receivable. Otherwise, the Group acts as an 
agent and recognizes revenue based on the amount of commission or handling fee to which it is expected to be entitled, 
which is determined based on the net amount of the total consideration received or receivable less the consideration payable 
to other related parties, or based on a predetermined commission amount or proportion, etc. 
 
29.1 Revenue from sale of products  
 
Product sales revenue is the revenue from sales of video surveillance products, smart home products, robotics products 
and other products of the Group. 
 
According to the contract, the Group recognizes revenue when the control of the product is transferred, that is, when the 
product is handed over to the agreed carrier or delivered to the place designated by the other party for receipt. As the 
delivery of the products to the customer represents the right to receive the contract consideration unconditionally, and the 
maturity of the payment is only subject to the passage of time, the Group recognises a receivable when the product is 
delivered to the customer. When a customer prepays for a purchase, the Group recognises the transaction amount received 
as a contractual liability until revenue is recognized when the product is delivered to the customer. 
 
There is variable consideration in the product sales contracts between the Group and its distributors. The Group determines 
the best estimate of the variable consideration based on the expected delivery time, quantity and price of the products. The 
transaction price, including variable consideration, does not exceed the amount by which the accrued recognized revenue 
is unlikely to be materially reversed at the time the relevant uncertainty is eliminated. At each balance sheet date, the 
Group re-estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price.

For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
276 
When the Group sells products to distributors, it provides an additional purchase option under sales incentives, i.e., the 
Group's distributors can accumulate sales rebates when purchasing specific products from the Group and use them to offset 
the price of goods in future purchases. These sales rebates provide resellers with discounts on their future purchases that 
are not available to similar customers. As a result, the commitment to provide the dealer with a credit for future purchases 
is a separate performance obligation that is recognized as a contractual liability at the time of the sale transaction at the 
transaction price apportioned to the fair value of the rebate, and revenue is recognized when the reseller uses the sales 
rebate offset. 
 
The Group provides quality assurance for the products sold, and the quality assurance related to the products sold by the 
Group cannot be purchased separately, but is to assure customers that the products sold meet the established standards, so 
the Group carries out accounting treatment in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standard for Business 
Enterprises No. 13 - Contingencies. 
 
For product sales of the Group with sales return terms attached, as the customer obtains ownership of related products, the 
Group recognizes revenue in accordance with the consideration (excluding expected refund amounts due to sales returns) 
that the Group is expected to receive due to the transfer of products or services to the customer, and recognizes expected 
liabilities in accordance with expected refund amounts due to sales returns. The remaining amount, subsequent to 
deduction of expected costs from collecting the products (including the decrease in value of the returned products), is 
recognized as an asset in accordance with the carrying amount during the expected transfer of returned products after 
deducting the costs of the above net assets carried forward. 
 
Some of the Group's product sales contracts have instalment payment clauses, and there is a significant financing 
component in the contract, the Group determines the transaction price based on the amount payable in cash when the 
customer assumes control of the products. The difference between the transaction price and the contract consideration is 
amortized using the effective interest rate method during the contract period. On the contract commencement date, the 
Group does not consider the significant financing components in the contract if the interval between the customer obtaining 
control of the products and the price being paid by the customer is not more than one year. 
 
29.2 Project construction revenue 
 
Project construction revenue is the revenue from constructions related to intelligent security solution projects and PPP 
Projects provided by the Group. 
 
For project construction, the customer is able to control the assets under construction in the course of the Group's 
performance, and the Group regards them as a performance obligation to be performed within a certain period of time, and 
the revenue is recognized according to the performance progress, unless the performance progress cannot be reasonably 
determined.
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
277 
The Group uses the output method to determine the progress of performance, which is to determine the progress of 
performance based on the value of engineering construction services transferred to customers. If the progress of 
performance cannot be reasonably determined and the costs incurred by the Group are expected to be compensated, 
revenue is recognized according to the amount of costs incurred until the progress of performance can be reasonably 
determined. 
 
The Group's customers make milestone payments with the Group in respect of projects in accordance with the terms of 
the contract. The Group first recognizes the completed performance obligations as contract assets and reclassifies them as 
accounts receivable when the payment milestone is reached; if the contract price received or receivable by the Group 
exceeds the accumulated performance obligations completed, the excess part is recognized as a contract liability. The 
Group's contract assets and contractual liabilities under the same contract are presented on a net basis. 
 
Some of the Group's construction contracts have long-term payment clauses, and there are significant financing elements 
in the contracts. The Group determines the transaction price on the basis of the amount payable in cash on the assumption 
that the customer will take control of the asset-building. The difference between the transaction price and the contract 
consideration is amortized over the life of the contract using the effective interest method. At the commencement date of 
the contract, the Group expects that the interval between the customer obtaining control of the service and the customer 
paying the price will not exceed one year, regardless of the significant financing component existing in the contract. 
 
The Group, as a private capital, entered into a PPP project contract with the government and provided construction, 
operation, maintenance and other services. The Group identifies construction services, operation services and maintenance 
services as individual performance obligations in the contract, and allocates the transaction price to each performance 
obligation based on the relative proportion of the stand-alone selling price of each performance obligation. When providing 
construction services or outsourcing projects to other parties, The identity of the Group is the principal responsible person, 
and then accounting for construction revenue to confirm the contract assets is made. After the PPP project is ready for use, 
the Group recognizes revenue related to operation and maintenance services. 
 
29.3 Cloud service and other service revenue 
 
Revenue from cloud services and other services refers to cloud services such as storage services, video services, and 
telephone services provided by the Group, maintenance services related to security projects, and other services, etc. 
 
For cloud services and other services, the economic benefits brought by the customer are obtained and consumed at the 
time of the Group's performance, and the Group regards them as a performance obligation to be performed within a certain 
period, and the revenue is recognized according to the performance progress during the period of providing services. The 
Group adopts the output approach to determine the performance progress, i.e. the performance progress is determined 
based on the value of the services transferred to the customer to the customer. The customer paid for the cloud services in 
advance at the time of purchase, so the Group recognized the cloud service payment received at the time of the transaction
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
278 
as a contractual liability, and recognized the revenue according to the performance progress during the period of the 
provision of the services. The Group presents contract assets and contract liabilities under the same contract on a net basis. 
 
For the provision of operation and maintenance services to customers, the economic benefits obtained and consumed by 
the customers at the same time as the performance of the contract by the Group shall be regarded as the performance 
obligation to be performed within a certain period of time, and the revenue shall be recognized according to the 
performance progress. The Group's customers make milestone payments with the Group for O&M services in accordance 
with the terms of the contract. The Group first recognizes completed performance obligations as contract assets and 
reclassifies them as accounts receivable when payment milestones are reached, and if the contract price received or 
receivable by the Group exceeds the accumulated performance obligations completed, the excess part is recognized as a 
contract liability. The Group's contract assets and contractual liabilities under the same contract are presented on a net 
basis. 
 
For the provision of operation and maintenance services to customers, the economic benefits obtained and consumed by 
the customers at the same time as the performance of the contract by the Group shall be regarded as the performance 
obligation to be performed within a certain period of time, and the revenue shall be recognized according to the 
performance progress. The Group's customers make milestone payments with the Group for O&M services in accordance 
with the terms of the contract. The part of the Group that has obtained the unconditional right to receive payment is 
recognized as accounts receivable, and the remainder is recognized as contract assets, and if the contract price received or 
receivable by the Group exceeds the accumulated performance obligations completed, the excess part is recognized as a 
contract liability. The Group's contract assets and contractual liabilities under the same contract are presented on a net 
basis. 
 
30. Cost of Contract 
30.1 Cost of obtaining a contract 
 
Incremental costs incurred by the Group to obtain a contract (that is, costs that would not have occurred without a contract) 
and expected to be recovered are recognized as an asset, and amortized using the same basis as revenue recognition for 
the goods or services to which the asset relates, and included in current profit or loss. If the amortization period of the 
asset does not exceed one year, it is included in current profit or loss when it occurs. Other expenses incurred by the Group 
in order to obtain the contract shall be included in current profit or loss when incurred, unless it is clearly borne by the 
customer.  
 
30.2 Cost of contract fulfillment 
 
The cost of the Group’s performance of a contract that does not fall within the scope of accounting standards other than 
the revenue standard and meets the following conditions is recognized as an asset: (1) The cost is directly related to a
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
279 
current or anticipated contract; (2) The cost increases the Group’s resources for fulfilling performance obligations in the 
future; (3) The cost is expected to be recovered. The aforesaid assets are amortized on the same basis as the recognition 
of income from goods or services related to the assets, and are included in the current profit or loss. 
The Group’s asset in relation to contract costs are mainly contract performance costs, and they are included in inventories 
based on their current nature. 
 
30.3 Impairment losses on assets related to contract costs 
 
In determining impairment losses on assets related to contract costs, impairment losses are first determined for other assets 
recognized in accordance with other relevant ASBEs and related to the contract. Then, for assets related to contract costs 
whose carrying value is higher than the difference between the following two items, the Group makes provision for 
impairment for the excess to be recognized as asset impairment losses: (1) the remaining amount of consideration expected 
to be obtained by the Group for the transfer of goods or services related to the asset; (2) the estimated costs to be incurred 
in connection with the transfer of such relevant goods or services. 
 
After provision for impairment is made for the asset related to contract costs, if the difference between the above two items 
is higher than the carrying value of the asset due to changes in the factors of impairment in previous periods, the original 
provision for impairment of the asset is reversed and included in the current profit or loss, but the carrying value of the 
asset after the reversal shall not exceed the carrying value of the asset on the reversal date assuming no provision for 
impairment is made. 
 
31. Governmental Subsidies 
Government subsidies refer to the monetary and non-monetary assets obtained by the Group from the government for free. 
Government subsidies are recognized when they can meet the conditions attached to the government subsidies and can be 
received. 
 
If a government subsidy is a monetary asset, it shall be measured at the amount received or receivable. 
 
31.1 Judgment basis and Accountant treatment of government subsidy related to assets 
 
The government subsidies for some special subsidies and etc. are used for constructions and forms long-term assets, and 
therefore are categorized as government subsidy related to assets.  
 
A government grant related to an asset is recognized as deferred income, and it should be evenly amortized to profit or 
loss over the useful life of the related asset.

31.2 Judgment basis and accountant treatment of government subsidy related to income 
 
The Group receives government subsidies including subsidies for special projects and Value-Added-Tax refund, etc. which 
are used to compensate the group-related costs or losses, and therefore are categorized as government subsidy related to 
income. 
 
For a government grant related to income, if the subsidy is a compensation for related expenses or losses to be incurred in 
subsequent periods, it is recognized as deferred income, and recognized in profit or loss over the periods in which the 
related costs or losses are recognized; If the subsidy, such as VAT refund, is a compensation for related expenses or losses 
already incurred, it is recognized immediately in profit or loss for the period. 
 
For government subsidies related to the Group’s daily operations shall be booked into other income; for those not related 
to the Group’s daily operations, shall be booked into non-operating income/expense.  
32. Lease  
Lease refers to a contract that conveys the right to use an asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.  
 
The Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at the inception date. The Group does not re-assess whether 
a contract contains a lease unless the terms and conditions of the contract are changed.  
 
32.1 The Group as the lessee  
 
32.1.1 
Separating components of lease 
 
In case the contract contains one or more lease and non-lease components, the Group separates each lease component and 
non-lease component, and allocates the consideration to the lease and non-lease components based on the proportion of 
relative stand-alone prices of the components.  
 
32.1.2 
Right-of-use assets  
 
The Group recognizes the right-of-use assets for leases on the commencement date of the lease term, except for short-term 
lease and lease of low-value assets. The commencement date of the lease term refers to the date from which the lessor 
makes the leased assets available for use by the Group. Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost. The cost includes:  
• 
Initial measurement amount of lease liabilities;
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
281 
• 
Amount of lease payment made at or before the commencement date of the lease, less any lease incentives received;  
• 
Initial direct costs incurred by the Group;  
• 
An estimate of any costs to be incurred by the Group in dismantling and removing the underlying asset, or restoring 
the site on which it is located, or restoring the leased assets to the conditions as agreed under the terms of the lease, 
excluding costs incurred to produce inventories.  
 
The Group calculates depreciation of the right-of-use assets in accordance with the relevant depreciation provisions of 
Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 4 - Fixed Assets. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter 
of the lease term and the useful life of the right-of-use asset, unless there is a transfer of ownership or purchase option 
which is reasonably certain to be exercised at the end of the lease term.  
 
The Group determines whether the right-of-use assets are impaired and accounts for the identified impairment loss in 
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 8 - Impairment of Assets.  
 
32.1.3 
Lease liabilities  
 
The Group initially measures the lease liability on the commencement date at an amount equal to the present value of the 
lease payments during the lease term that are not paid at that date, except short-term lease and lease of low-value assets. 
In calculating the present value of the lease payments, the Group adopts the interest rate implicit in the lease as the discount 
rate. The Group uses its incremental borrowing rate if the interest rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined.  
 
Lease payments refer to the payments made by the Group to the lessor in connection with the right to use the leased asset 
during the lease term, including:  
• 
Fixed payments, including in-substance fixed payments, less any lease incentives receivable;  
• 
The exercise price of a purchase option, if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option;  
• 
Payments for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising the option to terminate the lease; 
• 
Amounts expected to be payable by the Group under residual value guarantees. 
 
After the commencement date of the lease term, the Group calculates interest expense of lease liabilities in each period of 
lease term at fixed periodic rate and recognizes in the current loss and profit or relevant asset costs.  
 
After the commencement date of the lease term, the Group remeasures the lease liability and adjusts the corresponding 
right-of-use assets under the following circumstances. If the carrying value of the right-of-use assets has been reduced to 
zero while the lease liability needs to be further reduced, the Group will recognize the difference into the current loss and 
profit:  
• 
In case of any change of the lease term or any change in the valuation of the purchase option, the Group remeasures 
the lease liability at the present value calculated based on the modified lease payments and the revised discount rate;
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
282 
• 
In the event of any change in the amount expected to be payable based on the residual value guarantees, the Group 
remeasures the lease liability at the present value calculated based on the changed lease payments and the original 
discount rate.  
 
32.1.4 
Basis for judgment and accounting treatment of the lessee's simplified treatment of short-term leases and leases 
of low-value assets   
 
The Group has elected not to recognize the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases and leases of low-
value assets. Short-term lease refers to lease with a term no more than 12 months from the commencement date of lease 
term and without purchase option. Lease of low-value assets refers to lease for single lease asset with low value when it 
is new. The Group recognizes lease payments under short-term leases and leases of low-value assets as the current loss 
and profit or the relevant asset costs on a straight-line basis over each period during the lease term.  
 
32.1.5 
Lease modification  
 
In case of lease modification, the Group makes accounting treatment of such lease change as a separate lease if all of the 
following conditions are met: 
• 
Such lease modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more lease assets;  
• 
The increased consideration is commensurate with the stand-alone price for the increase in scope and any appropriate 
adjustments to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract.  
 
Where accounting treatment is not made for lease modification as a separate lease, at the effective date of lease 
modification, the Group reallocates the contract consideration after the modification, redetermines the lease term, and 
remeasures the lease liability based on the present value calculated according to the modified lease payments and the 
revised discount rate.  
 
In the event that the lease scope is decreased or the lease term is shortened as a result of the lease modification, the Group 
reduces the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets, and recognizes the relevant gains or losses relating to the partial or 
full termination of the lease in the income statement; for the lease liabilities remeasured due to other lease modifications, 
the Group adjusts the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets accordingly.  
 
32.2 The Group as the lessor  
 
32.2.1 
Separating components of lease  
 
In case the contract contains both lease and non-lease components, the Group allocates the contract consideration in 
accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises No. 14 - Revenue on portion of
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
283 
transaction prices, based on the respective stand-alone prices of the lease component and the non-lease component.  
 
32.2.2 
Classification criteria and accounting treatment for leases as lessors  
 
Finance lease is a lease that substantially transfers all the risks and rewards of incidental to ownership of an underlying 
asset. Operating lease refers to the leases other than finance lease.  
 
32.2.2.1 The Group records the operating lease business as the lessor  
The Group recognizes the lease payments from operating leases as rental income on a straight-line basis for all periods 
over the lease term. The Group's initial direct costs incurred in connection with operating leases is capitalized as incurred, 
recognized in the income statement over the lease term on the same basis as the lease income.  
 
32.2.2.2 The Group records the finance lease business as the lessor  
 
On the commencement date of the lease term, the Group uses the net lease investment as the carrying value of the finance 
lease receivables and derecognizes the finance lease assets. Net lease investment is the sum of present value of 
unguaranteed residual value and lease payments receivable discounted at the interest rate implicit in lease on the 
commencement date of the lease term.  
 
Lease payments receivable, which refer to amounts receivable by the Group from the lessee for conveying the right to use 
the leased assets during the lease term, include:  
• 
Fixed payment including in-substance fixed payments by the lessee, less any lease incentives payable;  
• 
The exercise price of a purchase option, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option;  
• 
Payments for terminating the lease (if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising the option to terminate the lease; 
• 
Residual value guarantees provided to the Group by the lessee, a party related to the lessee, or a third party unrelated 
to the lessor that is capable of discharging the obligations under the guarantee. 
The Group calculates and recognizes the interest income in each period of the lease term according to the fixed periodic 
interest rate.  
 
In financial leases in which the Group acts as a manufacturer or distributor as the lessor, on the commencement date of 
the lease term, the Group recognizes revenue based on the lower of the fair value of the leased assets and the present value 
of the lease receipts discounted at the market rate, and carries forward the cost of sales based on the balance of the carrying 
amount of the leased assets after deducting the present value of the unsecured residual value. 
 
The costs incurred by the Group acting as a manufacturer or distributor as a lessor to obtain a financial lease are recognized 
in profit or loss for the current period on the commencement date of the lease term.

32.2.3 
Lease modification  
 
In case of modification of the operating lease, the Group accounts for it as a new lease as of the effective date of the 
modification, any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to the original lease are considered as payments for the new 
lease .  
 
In case of modification of the finance lease, the Group accounts for the modification of a finance lease as a separate lease 
if all of the following conditions are met:  
• 
The modification increases the scope of the lease by adding the right to use one or more lease assets;  
• 
The consideration for the lease increases by an amount that is commensurate with the stand-alone price for the 
increase in scope, and any appropriate adjustments to that price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract.  
 
If a modification of finance lease is not accounted for as a separate lease, the Group accounts for the changed lease under 
the following circumstances:  
• 
If the modification becomes effective on the commencement date of the lease and the lease is classified as an 
operating lease, the Group accounts for it as a new lease from the effective date of the lease modification and measures 
as the net lease investment prior to the effective date of the lease modification as the carrying value of the leased 
asset.  
• 
If the modification becomes effective on the commencement date of the lease and the lease is classified as a finance 
lease, the Group accounts for it in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises 
No. 22 - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Instruments regarding the modification or renegotiation of 
contracts.  
 
33. Deferred Tax Assets / Deferred Tax Liabilities 
The income tax expenses include current income tax and deferred income tax.  
 
33.1. Current Income Tax 
 
At the balance sheet date, current income tax liabilities (or assets) for the current and prior periods are measured at the 
amount expected to be paid (or recovered) according to the requirements of tax laws.

For temporary differences between the carrying amounts of certain assets or liabilities and their tax base, or between the 
nil carrying amount of those items that are not recognized as assets or liabilities and their tax base that can be determined 
according to tax laws, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized through the balance sheet liability method. 
 
In general, all temporary differences are recognized as the relevant deferred income tax. However, for deductible 
temporary differences, the Group recognizes the relevant deferred tax assets to the extent that it is likely to obtain the 
taxable income to offset the deductible temporary differences. In addition, deferred tax assets or liabilities relating to the 
initial recognition of goodwill, as well as those arising from transactions that are neither a business combination nor affect 
accounting profits and taxable income (or deductible losses) and do not result in equal taxable and deductible temporary 
differences, are not recognized. 
 
For deductible losses and tax credits that can be carried forward, deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is 
probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the deductible losses and tax credits can be utilized. 
 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except 
where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the 
temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary 
differences associated with such investments are only recognized to the extent that it is probable that there will be taxable 
profits against which to utilize the benefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable 
future.  
 
On the balance sheet date, the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are measured at the applicable 
tax rates in the period in which the related assets are recovered or the related liabilities are recovered in accordance with 
the tax laws. 
 
Current and deferred tax expenses or income are recognized in profit or loss for the period, except when they arise from 
transactions or events that are directly recognized in other comprehensive income or in shareholders' equity, in which case 
they are recognized in other comprehensive income or in shareholders' equity; and when they arise from business 
combinations, in which case they adjust the carrying amount of goodwill. 
 
At the balance sheet date, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed and reduced if it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available in the future to allow the benefit of deferred tax assets to be utilized. Such 
reduction in amount is reversed when it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available.

33.3 Offset of Income Tax  
 
When the Group has a legal right to settle on a net basis and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realize the assets 
and settle the liabilities simultaneously, current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset and presented on a net basis. 
 
When the Group has a legal right to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis, and deferred tax assets and 
deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or 
different taxable entities which intend either to settle current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis or to realize the assets 
and liabilities simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax assets or liabilities are 
expected to be reversed, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset and presented on a net basis. 
 
34. Important Judgments while Applying Accounting Policy, and Key Assumptions and Uncertainty Factors 
Applied for Accounting Estimate 
During the process of using accounting policy described in note (III), due to the uncertainty in operation activities, the 
group should judge, estimate and assume the book value of the report items which may not be metered reliably. These 
judgments, estimates and assumptions are based on the historical experience of the Group's management and other related 
factors. Differences may exist between the actual results and the Group’s estimate.  
 
The Group regularly reviews the above judgments, assumptions and estimations on the basis of continuous operation. If 
the changes of accounting estimate only influence current period, the influence amount will be affirmed during the 
changing period; if it influences the current period and subsequent periods, the influence amount will be recognized in the 
current period and future period.  
 
- Key assumptions and uncertainties used in accounting estimate  
On balance sheet date, key assumptions and uncertainties for performing accounting estimates on book value of assets and 
liabilities in subsequent future periods are:   
Impairment provision for inventories 
Except for contract performance costs, inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. For raw 
materials, the latest or future actual purchase price is used as the basis for determining the net realizable value; For products 
in progress, the net realizable value is determined by the actual selling price of the most recent or post-period finished 
product, less the estimated costs of the current similar type at the time of completion of the product, the estimated sales 
expenses and related taxes; For finished products, the actual selling price of the latest or future finished product minus the
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
287 
estimated selling expenses and related taxes will be incurred, is used as the basis for determining the net realizable value. 
The Group will regularly conduct a comprehensive stocktaking to review the impairment circumstances on defective, 
obsoleted or slow-moving inventory if any; in addition, the Group's management will regularly review the impairment 
circumstance of inventory with long storage time according to the inventory aging.. Based on the above procedure, the 
Group's management deems that the full provision amounts have been withdrawn for inventory. For details, please refer 
to Note (V) 9. 
 
Impairment of accounts receivable 
 
Except for accounts receivable whose credit losses are determined on the basis of individual basis, the Group adopts an 
impairment matrix on a portfolio basis to determine its expected credit loss of the relevant accounts receivable. The Group 
divides the risk characteristics according to the region and object of its business, and divides the relevant accounts 
receivable into different portfolios. Based on the historical loss rate and consider reasonable and well-founded forward-
looking information in the industry, the Group determines the proportion of corresponding loss reserves for different 
portfolios of various types of accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2023, based on the historically loss rate and consider 
reasonable and well-founded forward-looking information in the industry, the Group determines the corresponding 
proportion of loss provision for accounts receivable. The amount of the provision for expected credit losses will change 
as the estimation of the Group. The details on the provision for expected credit losses of the accounts receivable of the 
Group are given in Note (V) 4.  
 
Useful life and predicted net residual value of fixed asset 
 
The Group's estimation of fixed assets useful life is based on the historical experience of actual usable term of fixed assets 
with similar properties and functions, the estimation of predicted net residual value is the amount obtained currently by 
the Group from the assets after deducting the anticipated disposal expense based on the anticipated status assuming the 
conditions that fixed assets' predicted useful life expires and fixed assets are at the end of useful life. The Group shall 
conduct the review on the predicted service life and predicted net residual value of fixed assets at least annually. For the 
current reporting period, the Group's management did not see signs either indicating a shortened or extended useful life of 
the Group’s fixed asset or indicating a change in predicted net residual value.  
 
Accrued liabilities of product quality warranty 
 
Accrued liabilities of product quality assurance are costs and expenses incurred to meet the established standards of 
product quality assurance obligations to customers in accordance with the product contract; the Group made such an 
estimation according to the predicted claim rate, repair and replacement cost of relevant products. The management deems
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report 
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
288 
that the current estimation on accrued liabilities of product quality warranty is reasonable, however, the Group will 
continue to review the conditions of product repairs, and will conduct adjustment if any sign indicating the need to make 
adjustments on accounting estimates.  
 
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities 
 
Deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are measured at the applicable income tax rate during the 
period when the relevant asset is expected to be recovered or the relevant debt is expected to be paid off. The expected 
applicable income tax rate is determined according to the relevant current tax regulations and the actual situation of the 
Group. If the estimated income tax rate is different from the original estimate, the management of the Group will adjust it. 
 
The realization of deferred income tax assets mainly depends on the actual future taxable income, taxable temporary 
differences, and the effective tax rate of temporary difference in the future applicable years. If the actual taxable income 
and taxable temporary differences in the future is less than the estimation, or actual tax rate is lower than the estimation, 
then the confirmed deferred income tax assets will be reversed and confirmed in the income statement during the 
corresponding period. If the actual taxable income and taxable temporary differences in the future is more than the 
estimation, or actual tax rate is higher than the estimation, then the deferred tax assets that are partially unrecognized 
deductible losses and deductible temporary differences will be recognized and confirmed in the income statement during 
the corresponding period.  
 
Goodwill impairment 
 
When testing goodwill for impairment, a pre-tax interest discount rate that appropriately reflects the current market time 
value of money and asset-specific risk is determined and the present value of the projected future cash flows of the relevant 
asset group or combination of asset groups containing goodwill is calculated. When the future actual result is different 
from the original estimation, the result of the goodwill impairment test will alter.  
 
35. Significant Alternation in Accounting Policy and Accounting Estimations 
Interpretation No. 16 of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises 
 
The Ministry of Finance issued the Interpretation No. 16 of Accounting Standards for Business Enterprises (the 
""Interpretation No. 16"") on November 30, 2022. It specifies the accounting treatment of the income tax effects on dividends

289 
modification of cash-settled share-based payments to equity-settled share-based payments by an enterprise. The 
Interpretation No. 16 amends the scope of the initial recognition exemption for deferred income tax in ASBE No. 18 – 
Income Tax. It clarifies that for single transaction that are not business combinations, where neither accounting profits nor 
taxable income (or deductible losses) are affected at the time of the transaction, and the assets and liabilities initially 
recognized result in equal taxable temporary differences and deductible temporary differences do not apply to the 
provisions of ASBE No. 18 – Income Tax on exemption from initial recognition of deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax 
assets. This regulation is effective as of January 1, 2023, and can be implemented in advance. The Group implemented 
this requirement on January 1, 2023, applied retrospective adjustment method for accounting treatment, and restated the

Description of credit loss provision by portfolios for accounts receivable 
  
As part of the Group's credit risk management, the Group uses an impairment matrix to determine expected credit losses based on the ageing of accounts receivable beyond the credit 
period, and divides the risk characteristics account receivables into portfolio A, portfolio B and portfolio C according to the risk characteristics of business areas and objects. And the 
Company uses an impairment matrix to determine expected credit losses of each portfolio based on the ageing of accounts receivable beyond the credit period. These three portfolios 
involve a large number of customers with the same risk characteristics. Aging information is able to reflect the solvency of these three types of customers when the accounts receivable 
are due.

3) 
Goodwill impairment provision 
When the Group conducts impairment test on goodwill at the end of the reporting period, the key assumptions adopted 
and their basis are as follows: 
 
The recoverable amount of asset group portfolios containing apportioned goodwill is determined according to the present 
value of the estimated future cash flow of the relevant asset group portfolios. The forecast period for future cash flows is 
5 years. The projection of future cash flows is based on management's estimate of sales revenue, cost of sales and operating 
expenses for the expected period based on past performance and expectations of market developments. The cash flow 
growth rate over 5 years is 0-2%.. 
 
During the reporting period, the Group did not find that the recoverable amount of the relevant asset group portfolios 
including the apportioned goodwill was lower than its book value, so it is considered that there is no need to accrue 
impairment loss for goodwill.

The Group adopts sensitivity analysis techniques to analyze the possible effects of rational and probable changes in risk 
variables to profit or loss for the period or to the interests of shareholders. Since risk variables seldom change on a stand-
alone basis, while the correlation between variables may have significant influence to the ultimate amount of change 
effected by the change in a single risk variable, the analysis below is based on the assumption that the changes in each 
variable occurred separately. 
 
1. Objectives, Policies and Procedures of Risk Management, and changes in the reporting period 
 
The Group engages in risk management with the aim of achieving an appropriate balance between risk and return, where 
the negative effects of risks against the Group’s operating results are minimized, in order to maximize the benefits of 
shareholders and other stakeholders. Based on such objective in risk management, the underlying strategy of the Group’s 
risk management is to ascertain and analyze all types of risks exposures of the Group, establish appropriate risk tolerance 
thresholds, carry out risk management procedures and perform risk monitoring on all kinds of risks in a timely and reliable 
manner, thus containing risk exposures within a prescribed scope. 
 
1.1 Market risks 
 
1.1.1 Foreign exchange risks 
 
Foreign exchange risks refer to the risk that losses will occur because of changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company 
is primarily exposed to risks relating to the currencies such as USD, EUR and etc. The Group’s subsidiaries in the mainland 
of China whose procurement, sales and financing are denominated in RMB, USD and EUR. Other principal activities are 
settled in RMB. The Group’s subsidiaries in Hong Kong and outside China are principally engaged in procurement, sales, 
financing and other major business activities in local currencies such as USD, EUR and etc. 
 
As of December 31, 2023, except for monetary items of foreign currencies set out in Note (V) 62, the Group mainly 
adopted the functional currency of each of its subsidiary to present the balance of its assets and liabilities. The foreign 
exchange risks arising from assets and liabilities denominated in USD and EUR (which has been converted into RMB) as 
follows may generate significant impact on the operating results of the Group.

The Group has been paying close attention to the effect of fluctuation in exchange rate on the foreign exchange risks of 
the Group, and has purchased various financial derivative instruments, such as forward foreign exchange contracts to 
mitigate the foreign exchange risk exposure. 
 
Sensitivity analysis on exchange rate risk 
 
The sensitivity analysis of the Group's foreign exchange risk includes only monetary items denominated in foreign 
currencies and does not consider the impact of the purchased derivative financial instruments. 
With other variables unchanged, the exchange rate might float within a reasonable range, and has the following before-

1.1.2. Interest rate risk 
 
The risk of changes in cash flow of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates exposed to the Group are primarily 
related to bank borrowings bearing floating interest rate (please refer to Note (V) 34) and bank deposits bearing floating 
interest rate. The Group's risks of changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates are 
related to fixed-rate bank borrowings (please refer to Note (V) 24 and Note (V) 34) and fixed-rate bank deposits. 
 
The Group determines the relative proportion of fixed interest rate contracts and floating interest rate contracts based on 
the prevailing market environment. On December 31, 2023, the Group’s total long-term and short-term interest-bearing 
debts bearing fixed interest rates amounted to RMB 11,105,877,902.09 (December 31, 2022: RMB 9,106,539,532.31) 
(Note (V) 24 and Note (V) 34). The total amount of long-term and short-term interest-bearing debts bearing floating 
interest rates is RMB 5,546,156,677.17 (December 31, 2022: RMB2,262,287,174.62) (Note (V) 34). 
 
At present, the Group does not have any interest rate swap arrangements and will continue to pay close attention to the 
impact of changes in borrowing interest rates on the interest rate risk of the Group, and will make timely adjustments 
according to the latest market conditions. 
 
The Group expects that the exposure to cash flow risk arising from floating-rate bank deposits and the exposure to changes 
in fair value arising from fixed-rate bank deposits are not significant.  
 
1.1.3. Other price risks 
 
The Group’s price risk mainly arises from investments in held-for-trading equity instruments and derivative financial 
instruments. Held-for-trading equity instrument investments are all investments in unlisted held-for-trading equity 
instruments. 
 
The Group is exposed to price risk due to the holding of financial assets measured at fair value. The fair value of certain 
financial instruments is determined by the general pricing model based on discounted future cash flow method or other 
valuation techniques, while the valuation techniques are based on certain valuation assumptions. Therefore, the valuation 
results are highly sensitive to valuation assumptions. However, at the end of the current reporting period, the amount of
Hikvision 2023 Annual Report        
Notes to Financial Statements  
For the reporting period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 
 
351 
investment in held-for-trading equity instruments and derivative financial instruments is not significant, and the changes 
of the amount due to changes in price of financial instruments as a result of change in valuation assumptions is limited, 
accordingly, no sensitivity analysis is conducted. 
 
1.2 Credit Risk 
 
As of December 31, 2023, the largest credit risk exposure that may result in financial losses of the Group is mainly due to 
the loss of the Group’s financial assets arising from the failure of the counterparty to perform its obligations, including: 
cash and bank balances (Note (V) 1), notes receivable (Note (V) 3), accounts receivable (Note (V) 4), receivables for 
financing (Note (V) 6), other receivables (Note (V) 8), contract assets (Note (V) 5 and Note (V) 22), non-current assets 
due within one year (Note (V) 10), long-term receivables (Note (V) 12), etc., and derivative financial assets that are not 
included in the scope of impairment assessment and are measured at fair value through current profit or loss (Note (V) 2). 
As of the balance sheet date, the book value of the Group’s financial assets represents its maximum credit risk exposure. 
 
In order to reduce credit risk, the Group has arranged a team to determine the credit limit, conduct credit approval, and 
implement other monitoring procedures to ensure that necessary measures are taken to recover over-due debt. In addition, 
the Group reviews the recovery of financial assets on each balance sheet date to ensure that sufficient credit loss provisions 
are made for relevant financial assets. Therefore, the management of the Group believes that the credit risk exposure of 
the Group has been reduced significantly. 
 
The credit risk on cash and bank balances of the Group is low as they are deposited with banks with high credit ratings. 
 
For accounts receivable, contract assets and long-term receivables, the Group has put in place relevant policies to control 
credit risk exposure. The Group assesses credit quality of customers and sets corresponding credit period based on the 
customer’s financial status, the possibility of obtaining guarantees from third parties, credit history and other factors such 
as current market conditions. The Group will regularly monitor the credit history of its customers. For customers with 
poor credit history, the Group takes various measures, such as written payment reminders, shorten or cancel the credit 
period, to ensure that the overall credit risk of the Group is maintained in a controllable range. For accounts receivable, 
contract assets, and long-term receivables related to financial leasing and installment collection business, the Group uses 
a simplified method, that is, to measure the loss provision based on the amount equivalent to the expected credit loss for 
the entire duration. For details of the relevant expected credit loss measurement, see (Note (V) 4 & Note (V) 5). For 
remaining long-term receivables, the Group calculates the expected credit losses based on the expected credit loss rate in 
the next 12 months or the entire duration based on the default risk exposure. For details of the related expected credit loss 
measurement, see (Note (V) 12). 
 
With respect to bank acceptance bills and receivables financing, the Company believes that there is no significant credit 
risk and will not incur any significant losses due to the default of the counterparty as the acceptors are mainly banks with 
higher credit ratings. For financial company acceptance bills and commercial acceptance bills, the Company has set 
relevant policies to control credit risk exposure. The Company evaluates the credit status of the acceptor based on its 
financial position, credit history and other factors, such as current market conditions, and sets an internal credit rating for 
the acceptor. The Company regularly monitors the credit records of the acceptors, and for the acceptors with bad credit 
records, the Company adopts written reminders and other means to ensure that the overall credit risk is within a controllable 
range. For the acceptance bills and commercial acceptance bills receivable from financial companies, the Group calculates 
the expected credit loss based on the default risk exposure based on the expected credit loss ratio in the entire duration, 
and the relevant expected credit loss measurement is detailed in (Note (V) 3). 
 
For other receivables, the Group regularly monitors the debtor’s credit history. For debtors with poor credit history, the 
Group takes various measures such as written payment reminders to ensure that the Group’s overall credit risk is 
maintained in a controllable range. For other receivables, the Group calculates the expected credit loss based on the 
expected credit loss ratio in the next 12 months or the entire duration based on the default risk exposure. For details of the 
relevant expected credit loss measurement, see (Note (V) 8). 
 
The Group’s risk exposure is distributed among multiple contractors and multiple customers, so the Group has no 
significant credit concentration risk.

1.3. Liquidity risk 
 
The Group maintains and monitors a level of cash and cash equivalents deemed adequate by the management to meet the 
operation needs of the Group and to reduce the effect of cash flow movements when managing liquidity risk. The 
management of the Group monitors the usage of bank borrowings, and ensures compliance with borrowing agreements.

Description of accounts receivable for bad debts provision by portfolios 
  
As part of the Company's credit risk management, the Company's accounts receivable are divided into portfolio A, portfolio B and portfolio C according to the regional and object risk 
characteristics of the business, and the impairment matrix is used to determine the expected credit loss of each portfolio based on the aging of accounts receivable over credit period. For 
the accounts receivable generated by the Group’s related parties, because the payment time is arranged by the Group according to the cash flow of the companies in the Group, the 
Company believes that the credit risk is low and no provision for bad debts is required. The aging information can reflect the solvency of these three types of customers when the accounts 
receivable are due.

（二）报告期主要业务或产品简介 
随着人工智能、大数据和物联网技术的快速发展，数字化加速向各行业各领域广泛渗透，开创了全新的
行业和商业模式，成就了一批零售、传媒、文娱、本地生活等领域的数字化时代巨头公司。世界主要国家纷
纷出台战略和规划来推动数字化技术的加速应用。2016年，中国政府在《国民经济和社会发展第十三个五年
规划纲要》中提出，推动信息技术与经济社会发展深度融合，并首次提出“数字中国”的概念。2021年，在
《十四五规划和2035年远景目标》中，“数字中国”被确定为国家重要战略之一。
杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司2023 年年度报告摘要 
2 
随着数字化和数字化转型的深入开展，数据成为新的生产要素。对于绝大多数以物理世界为中心构建的
企业（可称为非数字原生企业），尤其是制造企业，过去已完成了大量的IT信息化工作，但对于其核心主营业
务流程，缺乏启动数字化转型的核心数据、缺乏基于数据实现智能控制和智能决策的产品和解决方案，仍然
是众多企业最大的痛点。 
物理世界场景的数字化是数字化转型的基础单元。物理世界广泛存在的“信号”，需要借助丰富的感知能
力来采集多维度、多类型的数据，才能实现在数字世界的映射。数字化转型需求具有用户个性化和高度碎片
化的特征。不同行业之间、乃至相同行业内的不同主体，对数字化转型的诉求都不尽相同，将技术和用户需
求深度结合，才能真正解决具体场景的数字化转型问题，让数字技术真正赋能业务。 
海康威视全面的感知能力助力更丰富的数据获取。海康威视以视频感知为基础，构建了包括可见光、热
成像、雷达、X 光等电磁波，声波、超声波等机械波，以及多种物理传感技术的全面感知体系。目前公司已
有的物联感知产品系列多达数万种，涵盖前端摄像机、音频、传感等多个品类，可实现图像、声音、振动、
温度等多维数据的全方位汇聚。 
海康威视多元的数字技术推动更深层次的数据价值释放。海康威视凭借着在云计算、大数据、人工智能
等技术领域的深厚积累和对智能物联的深刻理解，推出了“云边融合、物信融合、数智融合”的能力架构，
同时持续加大在基础算力和大模型建设上的投入和积累，不断提升数据处理与分析的能力。近期，海康威视
创新推出观澜大模型，促进人工智能更广泛的价值落地。 
海康威视深厚的行业理解力满足个性化的场景应用需求。目前海康威视已广泛覆盖10 余个主行业、近
90 个子行业的500 多个细分场景，在涉及生产生活、社会治理的诸多领域持续深耕。凭借渠道下沉以及长期
与行业客户的交流合作，公司积累了深厚的行业理解力和用户洞察力，可以更好地满足下游客户个性化、定
制化的数字化转型需求。 
面对势不可挡的数字化转型浪潮，海康威视将以更全面的感知技术、更创新的数字技术助力数字化转型
主体夯实数据底座；以更丰富的产品体系、更强大的平台能力响应各行各业高度定制化的数字化转型需求；
以更广泛的渠道覆盖、更开放的合作伙伴生态加速数字化转型的规模化落地，助力政府服务便捷高效、企业
经营提质增效、人民生活智慧安康。

会计政策变更的原因及会计差错更正的情况 
财政部于2022 年11 月30 日发布了《企业会计准则解释第16 号》，对《企业会计准则第18 号——所得税》中递延所得税初
始确认豁免的范围进行了修订，明确对于不是企业合并、交易发生时既不影响会计利润也不影响应纳税所得额（或可抵扣亏损）、
且初始确认的资产和负债导致产生等额应纳税暂时性差异和可抵扣暂时性差异的单项交易，不适用《企业会计准则第18 号—
—所得税》关于豁免初始确认递延所得税负债和递延所得税资产的规定。该规定自2023 年1 月1 日起施行，可以提前执行。
本集团自2023 年1 月1 日起施行该规定，采用追溯调整法进行会计处理，并重述了比较年度财务报表。

致股东 
2023 年，经营绩效逐季改善。PBG、EBG、SMBG、海外主业、创新业务，在复杂多变的
经营环境下，公司5 个业务板块业绩表现不尽相同，但也反映了公司经营更加稳健。 
无论业绩如何，公司都一直坚持长期主义，坚定地加大研发投入。8 年前开始，公司从电
磁波可见光频段的感知技术，陆续扩展到厘米波、毫米波、远红外、中波红外、短波红外、
紫外、X 光波段等感知技术，也扩展到次声波、声波、超声波波段的感知技术，并融合AI 技
术，逐步构建和完善AIoT 的技术体系，逐步推出和完善相关产品与解决方案，并取得了一定
的业绩。安防业务目前只是公司AIoT 战略的一个业务方向，公司通过增加非可见光探测器产
品线或融合多种探测器的产品线，提升公司在安防行业的竞争力。场景数字化，特别是企业
场景数字化，是公司AIoT 战略的另外一个业务方向，公司已经陆续推出了一些产品线，公司
正在成为OT（Operational Technology）厂商。公司将基于更加丰富的感知技术，为各类企
业数字化转型提供众多场景下的数字化产品和解决方案。公司会持续改善内部运作机制和优
化运营流程，成为各类企业数字化转型的伙伴。企业的数字化转型，是一个漫长的过程，为
公司未来业务增长提供了巨大的成长空间。 
公司已经把AI 技术应用到各种感知产品中，也把AI 技术与大数据技术结合，用于系统
解决方案中。公司在行业大模型和行业多模态大模型方面摸索、积累和发展，公司会继续发
展行业软件，为行业用户提供更合适的产品和系统解决方案。 
公司坚持国际化。虽然在一些国家受到严重打压，公司一直在加大海外市场的投入，海
外业务也一直在增长。公司会进一步加大海外市场营销的投入，进一步提升海外市场的竞争
力。

本公司提醒投资者认真阅读本报告全文，并特别注意下列风险因素： 
1) 地缘政治环境风险：全球地缘政治不确定性较高，政治格局分化，局部热战持续难解。近年来，
公司持续加强风险管控和提升应对能力，根据业务环境调整资源布局，但如果地缘政治环境进一步恶化，
公司在部分国家与地区的经营可能受到不利影响。 
2) 全球经济下行风险：全球部分主要经济体增速减缓，各地区发展不均，风险波动难以消除。公司
以广泛的业务布局分散单一区域的经营风险，根据各国各地实际状况开展业务，但如果出现全球经济衰退，
公司的业务也会受到一定的影响。 
3) 国内经济结构转型风险：国内基建、房地产相关市场持续调整，部分国家和产品受贸易保护政策
限制，劳动力优势削弱，经济处于转型升级过程中。公司以智能物联技术和产品赋能经济、社会数字化转
型，推动生产力的新发展，但转型升级难以一蹴而就，结构性压力长期存在，过程中出现的起伏仍将影响
公司业务开展。 
4) 供应链风险：全球供应体系受到地缘政治冲击，公司努力培育多元化供应网络，合理调控库存，
但如果发生供应链大范围中断的情况，仍将影响公司的业务稳定性。 
5) 技术更新换代风险：人工智能、大数据、物联网等技术迅猛发展，科技应用快速迭代。公司在物
联感知、人工智能、大数据等技术领域具备一定实力，并借助商业实践保持发展迭代，但如果不能密切追
踪前沿技术的更新变化，不能保持业务的创新拓展，公司未来发展的不确定性风险将会加大。 
6) 内部管理风险：公司经营规模持续扩大，新产品和新业务不断拓展，内部的管理复杂度上升，对
管理能力带来新的挑战。公司通过制度化、流程化方式沉淀管理经验，注重人才梯队培养与建设，但如果
公司管理水平跟不上业务发展，仍将给公司经营带来不利影响。 
7) 法律合规风险：世界多边贸易体制受政治冲击较大，商业活动需要遵守的各地法律法规复杂，世
界各国对数据的监管趋严，对公司的法律合规能力提出更高要求。公司不断加强法律合规体系建设，但如
果公司的法律合规能力无法跟上形势发展，仍将给公司经营带来不利影响。 
8) 汇率波动风险：公司在海外市场多个国家和地区开展经营，主要以外币结算。公司合理利用金融
工具削减风险，但销售、采购以及融资产生的外币敞口客观存在，汇率波动将影响公司的财务表现。 
9) 客户支付能力下降导致的资金风险：商业交易的资金流动受经济环境影响，公司回款机制健全，
经营勤勉稳健，积累了一定的现金储备，融资成本较低，但如果市场整体流动性风险增加，公司的回款速
度可能变慢，对经营带来不利影响。 
10) 网络安全风险：公司一贯重视网络安全，积极采取措施提升产品和系统安全性，但仍然可能存在
包括计算机病毒、恶意软件、黑客攻击等类似情况刻意尝试损害公司的系统或者产品，造成潜在的网络安
全问题。 
11) 知识产权风险：公司持续保持较大规模的研发投入，产出大量技术成果，实施了比较完善的知识
产权保护措施，但产生知识产权纠纷的风险和遭受知识产权侵害的风险仍然存在。 
上述提示未包括公司可能发生但未列示的其他风险，请投资者谨慎投资。

杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司全体股东： 
 
一、审计意见 
我们审计了杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司(以下简称“海康威视”或“贵集团”)的财务报表，包
括2023 年12 月31 日的合并及母公司资产负债表、2023 年度的合并及母公司利润表、合并及母公司现金流
量表、合并及母公司股东权益变动表以及相关财务报表附注。 
我们认为，后附的财务报表在所有重大方面按照企业会计准则的规定编制，公允反映了海康威视2023
年12 月31 日的合并及母公司财务状况以及2023 年度的合并及母公司经营成果和合并及母公司现金流量。 
 
二、形成审计意见的基础 
我们按照中国注册会计师审计准则的规定执行了审计工作。审计报告的“注册会计师对财务报表审计的
责任”部分进一步阐述了我们在这些准则下的责任。按照中国注册会计师职业道德守则，我们独立于海康威
视，并履行了职业道德方面的其他责任。我们相信，我们获取的审计证据是充分、适当的，为发表审计意见
提供了基础。 
 
三、关键审计事项 
关键审计事项是我们根据职业判断，认为对本期财务报表审计最为重要的事项。这些事项的应对以对财
务报表整体进行审计并形成审计意见为背景，我们不对这些事项单独发表意见。我们确定下列事项是需要
在审计报告中沟通的关键审计事项。
杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司2023 年年度报告 
155 
(一) 销售收入确认 
事项描述 
如附注(五)、46 所示，截至2023 年12 月31 日止年度，贵集团合并财务报表中实现营业收入人民币
89,339,856,855.68 元，其中产品销售收入为人民币84,971,000,242.56 元，占营业收入95.11%，金额重大且
对经营成果有重大影响，是集团的关键业绩指标。此外，产品销售收入涉及境内公司的产品内销及出口外
销、境外子公司在境外销售等不同销售模式，收入确认较为复杂。因此，我们将产品销售收入的发生作为关
键审计事项。 
 
审计应对 
我们针对上述关键审计事项所执行的主要审计程序包括： 
(1) 了解和评价与收入确认相关的关键内部控制的设计和执行，并测试其运行的有效性； 
(2) 针对不同销售模式下的收入，选取样本检查销售合同，查看其主要交易条款，评价收入确认是否符
合集团的会计政策和企业会计准则的要求；  
(3) 结合产品类型对收入及毛利情况进行分析，了解本年度收入及毛利是否存在异常波动的情况，并通
过收入数据的系统分析识别出的特定交易对其执行细节测试，检查相关的支持性文件； 
(4) 从本年记录的产品销售收入交易中选取样本，检查发票、销售合同或订单、发运单、签收单等支持
性文件，对于选取的境内公司的出口外销模式下收入样本追加检查至海关报关记录和装运记录。 
 
 (二)应收账款的信用损失准备 
事项描述 
如附注(五)、4 所示，截至2023 年12 月31 日止，贵集团合并财务报表中应收账款余额为人民币
39,006,606,967.83 元，应收账款的信用损失准备余额为人民币3,191,433,456.39 元。贵集团应收账款账面价
值较高，应收账款信用损失准备的计提对财务报表影响较为重大。如财务报表附注(三)、11.2、附注(三)、13
及附注(三)、34 所示，贵集团对于应收账款按照相当于整个存续期内预期信用损失的金额计提信用损失准
备。贵集团对单项金额重大且债务人发生重大财务困难等情况的应收账款，在单项资产的基础上确定其信
用损失；对于其他的应收账款以共同信用风险特征为依据划分为不同组合，在组合基础上计算预期信用损
失。 
对于划分为组合的应收账款，贵集团采用减值矩阵确定应收账款的预期信用损失准备。各组合的预期信
杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司2023 年年度报告 
156 
用损失计提比例是基于贵集团历史逾期比例和违约情况，并考虑行业前瞻性信息确定的。上述会计估计涉
及高度不确定性，因此，我们将组合确认的应收账款信用损失准备作为关键审计事项。 
 
审计应对 
我们针对上述关键审计事项所执行的主要审计程序包括： 
(1) 了解和评价贵集团与计提应收账款预期信用损失准备相关的关键内部控制的设计和执行，并测试
其运行的有效性； 
(2) 了解贵集团的应收账款预期信用损失的会计政策；并对组合确认的应收账款信用损失准备的模型
执行了以下主要程序： 
- 
评估减值矩阵模型计量方法的合理性，以及减值矩阵模型的关键参数和假设的合理性，包括不同组
合的划分，阶段划分，前瞻性调整等； 
- 
获取贵集团管理层确认应收账款历史损失率所使用的历史违约数据，评价其准确性； 
- 
选取样本测试贵集团管理层对组合划分和阶段划分的准确性； 
- 
按照违约损失百分比，重新计算预期信用损失准备。 
 
四、其他信息  
海康威视管理层对其他信息负责。其他信息包括年度报告中涵盖的信息，但不包括财务报表和我们的审
计报告。 
我们对财务报表发表的审计意见不涵盖其他信息，我们也不对其他信息发表任何形式的鉴证结论。 
结合我们对财务报表的审计，我们的责任是阅读其他信息，在此过程中，考虑其他信息是否与财务报表
或我们在审计过程中了解到的情况存在重大不一致或者似乎存在重大错报。 
基于我们已执行的工作，如果我们确定其他信息存在重大错报，我们应当报告该事实。在这方面，我们
无任何事项需要报告。 
 
五、管理层和治理层对财务报表的责任 
海康威视管理层负责按照企业会计准则的规定编制财务报表，使其实现公允反映，并设计、执行和维护
必要的内部控制，以使财务报表不存在由于舞弊或错误导致的重大错报。 
在编制财务报表时，管理层负责评估海康威视的持续经营能力，披露与持续经营相关的事项(如适用)，
杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司2023 年年度报告 
157 
并运用持续经营假设，除非管理层计划清算海康威视、终止运营或别无其他现实的选择。 
治理层负责监督海康威视的财务报告过程。 
 
六、注册会计师对财务报表审计的责任 
我们的目标是对财务报表整体是否不存在由于舞弊或错误导致的重大错报获取合理保证，并出具包含
审计意见的审计报告。合理保证是高水平的保证，但并不能保证按照审计准则执行的审计在某一重大错报
存在时总能发现。错报可能由于舞弊或错误导致，如果合理预期错报单独或汇总起来可能影响财务报表使
用者依据财务报表作出的经济决策，则通常认为错报是重大的。 
在按照审计准则执行审计工作的过程中，我们运用职业判断，并保持职业怀疑。同时，我们也执行以下
工作： 
(1) 识别和评估由于舞弊或错误导致的财务报表重大错报风险，设计和实施审计程序以应对这些风险，
并获取充分、适当的审计证据，作为发表审计意见的基础。由于舞弊可能涉及串通、伪造、故意遗漏、虚假
陈述或凌驾于内部控制之上，未能发现由于舞弊导致的重大错报的风险高于未能发现由于错误导致的重大
错报的风险。 
(2) 了解与审计相关的内部控制，以设计恰当的审计程序。 
(3) 评价管理层选用会计政策的恰当性和作出会计估计及相关披露的合理性。 
(4) 对管理层使用持续经营假设的恰当性得出结论。同时，根据获取的审计证据，就可能导致对海康威
视持续经营能力产生重大疑虑的事项或情况是否存在重大不确定性得出结论。如果我们得出结论认为存在
重大不确定性，审计准则要求我们在审计报告中提请报表使用者注意财务报表中的相关披露；如果披露不
充分，我们应当发表非无保留意见。我们的结论基于截至审计报告日可获得的信息。然而，未来的事项或情
况可能导致海康威视不能持续经营。

从与治理层沟通过的事项中，我们确定哪些事项对本期财务报表审计最为重要，因而构成关键审计事
项。我们在审计报告中描述这些事项，除非法律法规禁止公开披露这些事项，或在极少数情形下，如果合理
预期在审计报告中沟通某事项造成的负面后果超过在公众利益方面产生的益处，我们确定不应在审计报告
中沟通该事项。

(一) 
公司基本情况 
 
杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司(以下简称“公司”或“本公司”或“海康威视”)前身为杭州海康威视数
字技术有限公司，杭州海康威视数字技术有限公司系经杭州市高新技术产业开发区管理委员会杭高新
〔2001〕604号文批准设立的中外合资经营企业，于2001年11月30日在杭州市工商行政管理局登记注册。
经商务部商资批〔2008〕598号文批准，杭州海康威视数字技术有限公司整体变更为本公司，并于2008年
6月25日在浙江省工商行政管理局办妥变更登记。总部位于浙江省杭州市。公司股票于2010年5月28日在
深圳证券交易所挂牌交易。 
 
本公司及其子公司(以下简称“本集团”)主要经营活动包括制造和销售安防设备、网络设备、智能设备；
制造和批发汽车零部件及配件；销售电子产品；提供建设工程施工；技术服务、技术开发、技术咨询、
软件开发、信息系统集成服务、数据处理和存储支持服务等。 
 
本公司的公司及合并财务报表于2024年4月18日已经第五届董事会第二十次会议批准对外报出。 
 
 
(二) 
财务报表的编制基础 
 
编制基础 
 
本集团执行财政部颁布的企业会计准则及相关规定。此外，本集团还按照《公开发行证券的公司信息披
露编报规则第15号—财务报告的一般规定(2023年修订)》披露有关财务信息。 
 
持续经营 
 
本集团对自2023年12月31日起12个月的持续经营能力进行了评价，未发现对持续经营能力产生重大怀疑
的事项和情况。因此，本财务报表系在持续经营假设的基础上编制。 
 
记账基础和计价原则 
 
本集团会计核算以权责发生制为记账基础。除某些金融工具以公允价值计量外，本财务报表以历史成本
作为计量基础。资产如果发生减值，则按照相关规定计提相应的减值准备。 
 
在历史成本计量下，资产按照购置时支付的现金或者现金等价物的金额或者所付出的对价的公允价值计
量。负债按照因承担现时义务而实际收到的款项或者资产的金额，或者承担现时义务的合同金额，或者
按照日常活动中为偿还负债预期需要支付的现金或者现金等价物的金额计量。 
 
公允价值是市场参与者在计量日发生的有序交易中，出售一项资产所能收到或者转移一项负债所需支付
的价格。无论公允价值是可观察到的还是采用估值技术估计的，在本财务报表中计量和披露的公允价值
均在此基础上予以确定。 
 
以公允价值计量非金融资产时，考虑市场参与者将该资产用于最佳用途产生经济利益的能力，或者将该
资产出售给能够用于最佳用途的其他市场参与者产生经济利益的能力。 
 
对于以交易价格作为初始确认时的公允价值，且在公允价值后续计量中使用了涉及不可观察输入值的估
值技术的金融资产，在估值过程中校正该估值技术，以使估值技术确定的初始确认结果与交易价格相等。

(二)   财务报表的编制基础 - 续 
 
记账基础和计价原则 - 续 
 
公允价值计量基于公允价值的输入值的可观察程度以及该等输入值对公允价值计量整体的重要性，被划
分为三个层次： 
 
 
第一层次输入值是在计量日能够取得的相同资产或负债在活跃市场上未经调整的报价。 
 
第二层次输入值是除第一层次输入值外相关资产或负债直接或间接可观察的输入值。 
 
第三层次输入值是相关资产或负债的不可观察输入值。 
 
(三)

6. 
同一控制和非同一控制下企业合并的会计处理方法 
 
企业合并分为同一控制下的企业合并和非同一控制下的企业合并。 
 
6.1 
同一控制下的企业合并 
 
参与合并的企业在合并前后均受同一方或相同的多方最终控制，且该控制并非暂时性的，为同一控制下
的企业合并。 
 
在企业合并中取得的资产和负债，按合并日其在被合并方的账面价值计量。合并方取得的净资产账面价
值与支付的合并对价的账面价值的差额，调整资本公积中的股本溢价，股本溢价不足冲减的则调整留存
收益。 
 
为进行企业合并发生的各项直接费用，于发生时计入当期损益。 
 
6.2 
非同一控制下的企业合并及商誉 
 
参与合并的企业在合并前后不受同一方或相同的多方最终控制，为非同一控制下的企业合并。 
 
合并成本指购买方为取得被购买方的控制权而付出的资产、发生或承担的负债和发行的权益性工具的公
允价值。通过多次交易分步实现非同一控制下的企业合并的，合并成本为购买日支付的对价与购买日之
前已经持有的被购买方的股权在购买日的公允价值之和。购买方为企业合并而发生的审计、法律服务、
评估咨询等中介费用以及其他相关管理费用，于发生时计入当期损益。 
 
购买方在合并中所取得的被购买方符合确认条件的可辨认资产、负债及或有负债在收购日以公允价值计
量。 
 
合并成本大于合并中取得的被购买方可辨认净资产公允价值份额的差额，作为一项资产确认为商誉并按
成本进行初始计量。合并成本小于合并中取得的被购买方可辨认净资产公允价值份额的，首先对取得的
被购买方各项可辨认资产、负债及或有负债的公允价值以及合并成本的计量进行复核，复核后合并成本
仍小于合并中取得的被购买方可辨认净资产公允价值份额的，计入当期损益。 
 
因企业合并形成的商誉在合并财务报表中单独列报，并按照成本扣除累计减值准备后的金额计量。

重要会计政策及会计估计 - 续 
 
7. 
控制的判断标准和合并财务报表的编制方法 
 
7.1 
控制的判断标准 
 
控制是指投资方拥有对被投资方的权力，通过参与被投资方的相关活动而享有可变回报，并且有能力运
用对被投资方的权力影响其回报金额。一旦相关事实和情况的变化导致上述控制定义涉及的相关要素发
生了变化，本集团将进行重新评估。 
 
7.2 
合并财务报表的编制方法 
 
合并财务报表的合并范围以控制为基础予以确定。 
 
子公司的合并起始于本集团获得对该子公司的控制权时，终止于本集团丧失对该子公司的控制权时。 
 
对于本集团处置的子公司，处置日(丧失控制权的日期)前的经营成果和现金流量已经适当地包括在合并
利润表和合并现金流量表中。 
 
对于通过非同一控制下的企业合并取得的子公司，其自购买日(取得控制权的日期)起的经营成果及现金
流量已经适当地包括在合并利润表和合并现金流量表中。 
 
对于通过同一控制下的企业合并取得的子公司，无论该项企业合并发生在报告期的任一时点，视同该子
公司同受最终控制方控制之日起纳入本集团的合并范围，其自报告期最早期间期初起的经营成果和现金
流量已适当地包括在合并利润表和合并现金流量表中。 
 
子公司采用的主要会计政策和会计期间按照本公司统一规定的会计政策和会计期间厘定。 
 
本公司与子公司及子公司相互之间发生的内部交易对合并财务报表的影响于合并时抵销。 
 
子公司所有者权益中不属于母公司的份额作为少数股东权益，在合并资产负债表中股东权益项目下以“少
数股东权益”项目列示。子公司当期净损益中属于少数股东权益的份额，在合并利润表中净利润项目下以
“少数股东损益”项目列示。 
 
少数股东分担的子公司的亏损超过了少数股东在该子公司期初所有者权益中所享有的份额，其余额仍冲
减少数股东权益。 
 
对于购买子公司少数股权或因处置部分股权投资但没有丧失对该子公司控制权的交易，作为权益性交易
核算，调整归属于母公司所有者权益和少数股东权益的账面价值以反映其在子公司中相关权益的变化。
少数股东权益的调整额与支付/收到对价的公允价值之间的差额调整资本公积，资本公积不足冲减的，调
整留存收益。 
 
通过多次交易分步取得被购买方的股权，最终形成非同一控制下的企业合并的，分别是否属于“一揽子
交易”进行处理：属于“一揽子交易”的，将各项交易作为一项取得控制权的交易进行会计处理。不属
于“一揽子交易”的，在购买日作为取得控制权的交易进行会计处理，购买日之前持有的被购买方的股
权按该股权在购买日的公允价值进行重新计量，公允价值与账面价值之间的差额计入当期损益；购买日
前持有的被购买方的股权涉及权益法核算下的其他综合收益、其他所有者权益变动的，转为购买日所属
当期收益。

(三)    重要会计政策及会计估计 - 续 
 
8. 
合营安排分类及会计处理方法 
 
合营安排分为共同经营和合营企业，该分类通过考虑该安排的结构、法律形式以及合同条款等因素根据
合营方在合营安排中享有的权利和承担的义务确定。 
 
本集团对合营企业的投资采用权益法核算，具体参见附注(三)“18.3.2. 按权益法核算的长期股权投资”。 
 
9. 
现金及现金等价物的确定标准 
 
现金是指库存现金以及可以随时用于支付的存款。现金等价物是指本集团持有的期限短(一般指从购买日
起三个月内到期)、流动性强、易于转换为已知金额现金、价值变动风险很小的投资。 
 
10. 
外币业务和外币报表折算 
 
10.1  
外币业务 
 
外币交易在初始确认时采用与交易发生日即期汇率近似的汇率折算，与交易发生日即期汇率近似的汇率
按交易发生当月月初的市场汇价中间价计算确定。 
 
于资产负债表日，外币货币性项目采用该日即期汇率折算为人民币，因该日的即期汇率与初始确认时或
者前一资产负债表日即期汇率不同而产生的汇兑差额，除符合资本化条件的外币专门借款的汇兑差额在
资本化期间予以资本化计入相关资产的成本外，均计入当期损益。 
 
编制合并财务报表涉及境外经营的，如有实质上构成对境外经营净投资的外币货币性项目，因汇率变动
而产生的汇兑差额，列入其他综合收益的“外币报表折算差额”项目；处置境外经营时，计入处置当期损
益。 
 
以历史成本计量的外币非货币性项目仍以交易发生日的即期汇率折算的记账本位币金额计量。

外币财务报表折算 
 
为编制合并财务报表，境外经营的外币财务报表按以下方法折算为人民币报表：资产负债表中的所有资
产、负债类项目按资产负债表日的即期汇率折算；股东权益项目按发生时的即期汇率折算；利润表中的
所有项目及反映利润分配发生额的项目按与交易发生日即期汇率近似的汇率折算；折算后资产类项目与
负债类项目和股东权益类项目合计数的差额确认为其他综合收益并计入股东权益。 
 
外币现金流量以及境外子公司的现金流量，采用与现金流量发生日即期汇率近似的汇率折算，汇率变动
对现金及现金等价物的影响额，作为调节项目，在现金流量表中以“汇率变动对现金及现金等价物的影响
额”单独列示。

金融工具 
 
本集团在成为金融工具合同的一方时确认一项金融资产或金融负债。 
 
对于以常规方式购买或出售金融资产的，在交易日确认将收到的资产和为此将承担的负债，或者在交易
日终止确认已出售的资产。 
 
金融资产和金融负债在初始确认时以公允价值计量(金融资产和金融负债的公允价值的确定方法参见附
注(二)中记账基础和计价原则的相关披露)。对于以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产和金
融负债，相关的交易费用直接计入当期损益；对于其他类别的金融资产和金融负债，相关交易费用计入
初始确认金额。当本集团按照《企业会计准则第14 号——收入》(“收入准则”)初始确认未包含重大融资
成分或不考虑不超过一年的合同中的融资成分的应收账款时，按照收入准则定义的交易价格进行初始计
量。 
 
实际利率法是指计算金融资产或金融负债的摊余成本以及将利息收入或利息费用分摊计入各会计期间的
方法。 
 
实际利率，是指将金融资产或金融负债在预计存续期的估计未来现金流量，折现为该金融资产账面余额
或该金融负债摊余成本所使用的利率。在确定实际利率时，在考虑金融资产或金融负债所有合同条款(如
提前还款、展期、看涨期权或其他类似期权等)的基础上估计预期现金流量，但不考虑预期信用损失。 
 
金融资产或金融负债的摊余成本是以该金融资产或金融负债的初始确认金额扣除已偿还的本金，加上或
减去采用实际利率法将该初始确认金额与到期日金额之间的差额进行摊销形成的累计摊销额，再扣除累
计计提的损失准备(仅适用于金融资产)。

金融资产的分类、确认与计量 
 
初始确认后，本集团对不同类别的金融资产，分别以摊余成本、以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合
收益或以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益进行后续计量。 
 
金融资产的合同条款规定在特定日期产生的现金流量仅为对本金和以未偿付本金金额为基础的利息的支
付，且本集团管理该金融资产的业务模式是以收取合同现金流量为目标，则本集团将该金融资产分类为
以摊余成本计量的金融资产。本集团分类为以摊余成本计量的金融资产包括货币资金、应收票据、应收
账款、其他应收款、长期应收款和其他非流动资产等。 
 
金融资产的合同条款规定在特定日期产生的现金流量仅为对本金和以未偿付本金金额为基础的利息的支
付，且本集团管理该金融资产的业务模式既以收取合同现金流量为目标又以出售该金融资产为目标的，
则该金融资产分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的金融资产。此类金融资产自取得起期
限在一年以上的，列示为其他债权投资，自资产负债表日起一年内(含一年)到期的，列示于一年内到期的
非流动资产；取得时分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的应收票据，列示于应收款项融
资，其余取得时期限在一年内(含一年)项目列示于其他流动资产。 
 
初始确认时，本集团可以单项金融资产为基础，不可撤销地将非同一控制下的企业合并中确认的或有对
价以外的非交易性权益工具投资指定为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的金融资产。此类金
融资产作为其他权益工具投资列示。 
 
金融资产满足下列条件之一的，表明本集团持有该金融资产的目的是交易性的： 
 
 
取得相关金融资产的目的，主要是为了近期出售。 
 
相关金融资产在初始确认时属于集中管理的可辨认金融工具组合的一部分，且有客观证据表明
近期实际存在短期获利模式。 
 
相关金融资产属于衍生工具。 
 
以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产包括分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的
金融资产和指定为以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产： 
 
 
不符合分类为以摊余成本计量的金融资产、以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的金融
资产条件的金融资产均分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产。 
 
在初始确认时，为消除或显著减少会计错配，本集团可以将金融资产不可撤销地指定为以公允
价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产。 
 
以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产列示于交易性金融资产。自资产负债表日起超过一年
到期(或无固定期限)且预期持有超过一年的，列示于其他非流动金融资产。

11.1.1 以摊余成本计量的金融资产 
 
以摊余成本计量的金融资产采用实际利率法，按摊余成本进行后续计量，发生减值时或终止确认产生的
利得或损失，计入当期损益。 
 
本集团对以摊余成本计量的金融资产按照实际利率法确认利息收入。除下列情况外，本集团根据金融资
产账面余额乘以实际利率计算确定利息收入：  
 
 
对于购入或源生的已发生信用减值的金融资产，本集团自初始确认起，按照该金融资产的摊余
成本和经信用调整的实际利率计算确定其利息收入。 
 
对于购入或源生的未发生信用减值、但在后续期间成为已发生信用减值的金融资产，本集团在
后续期间，按照该金融资产的摊余成本和实际利率计算确定其利息收入。若该金融工具在后续
期间因其信用风险有所改善而不再存在信用减值，本集团转按实际利率乘以该金融资产账面余
额来计算确定利息收入。 
 
11.1.2 以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的金融资产 
 
分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的金融资产相关的减值损失或利得、采用实际利率法
计算的利息收入计入当期损益，除此以外该金融资产的公允价值变动均计入其他综合收益。该金融资产
计入各期损益的金额与视同其一直按摊余成本计量而计入各期损益的金额相等。该金融资产终止确认时，
之前计入其他综合收益的累计利得或损失从其他综合收益中转出，计入当期损益。 
 
指定为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的非交易性权益工具投资的公允价值变动在其他综合
收益中进行确认，该金融资产终止确认时，之前计入其他综合收益的累计利得或损失从其他综合收益中
转出，计入留存收益。本集团持有该等非交易性权益工具投资期间，在本集团收取股利的权利已经确立，
与股利相关的经济利益很可能流入本集团，且股利的金额能够可靠计量时，确认股利收入并计入当期损
益。 
 
11.1.3  以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产 
 
以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融资产以公允价值进行后续计量，公允价值变动形成的利得
或损失以及与该金融资产相关的股利和利息收入计入当期损益。

本集团对以摊余成本计量的金融资产、分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的金融资产、
租赁应收款以及合同资产以预期信用损失为基础进行减值会计处理并确认损失准备。 
 
本集团对由收入准则规范的交易形成且未包含重大融资成分或不考虑不超过一年的合同中的融资成分的
合同资产、应收票据及应收账款，以及由《企业会计准则第21号——租赁》规范的交易形成的应收租赁
款，按照相当于整个存续期内预期信用损失的金额计量损失准备。

金融工具减值 - 续 
 
对于其他金融工具，除购买或源生的已发生信用减值的金融资产外，本集团在每个资产负债表日评估相
关金融工具的信用风险自初始确认后的变动情况。若该金融工具的信用风险自初始确认后已显著增加，
本集团按照相当于该金融工具整个存续期内预期信用损失的金额计量其损失准备；若该金融工具的信用
风险自初始确认后并未显著增加，本集团按照相当于该金融工具未来12个月内预期信用损失的金额计量
其损失准备。信用损失准备的增加或转回金额，除分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的
金融资产外，作为减值损失或利得计入当期损益。对于分类为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收
益的金融资产，本集团在其他综合收益中确认其信用损失准备，并将减值损失或利得计入当期损益，且
不减少该金融资产在资产负债表中列示的账面价值。 
 
本集团在前一会计期间已经按照相当于金融工具整个存续期内预期信用损失的金额计量了损失准备，但
在当期资产负债表日，该金融工具已不再属于自初始确认后信用风险显著增加的情形的，本集团在当期
资产负债表日按照相当于未来12 个月内预期信用损失的金额计量该金融工具的损失准备，由此形成的
损失准备的转回金额作为减值利得计入当期损益。 
 
11.2.1 信用风险显著增加 
 
本集团利用可获得的合理且有依据的前瞻性信息，通过比较金融工具在资产负债表日发生违约的风险与
在初始确认日发生违约的风险，以确定金融工具的信用风险自初始确认后是否已显著增加。 
 
本集团在评估信用风险是否显著增加时会考虑如下因素： 
 
(1) 
信用风险变化所导致的内部价格指标是否发生显著变化； 
(2) 
金融工具外部信用评级实际或预期是否发生显著变化； 
(3) 
对债务人实际或预期的内部信用评级是否下调； 
(4) 
预期将导致债务人履行其偿债义务的能力发生显著变化的业务、财务或经济状况是否发生不利变
化； 
(5) 
债务人经营成果实际或预期是否发生显著变化； 
(6) 
债务人所处的监管、经济或技术环境是否发生显著不利变化； 
(7) 
作为债务抵押的担保物价值或第三方提供的担保或信用增级质量是否发生显著变化。这些变化预
期将降低债务人按合同规定期限还款的经济动机或者影响违约概率； 
(8) 
预期将降低借款人按合同约定期限还款的经济动机是否发生显著变化； 
(9) 
债务人预期表现和还款行为是否发生显著变化。 
 
无论经上述评估后信用风险是否显著增加，当金融工具合同付款已发生逾期超过(含)30 天的，则表明该
金融工具的信用风险已经显著增加。 
 
于资产负债表日，若本集团判断金融工具只具有较低的信用风险，则本集团假定该金融工具的信用风险
自初始确认后并未显著增加。如果金融工具的违约风险较低，借款人在短期内履行其合同现金流量义务
的能力很强，并且即使较长时期内经济形势和经营环境存在不利变化但未必一定降低借款人履行其合同
现金义务，则该金融工具被视为具有较低的信用风险。

11.2.2 已发生信用减值的金融资产 
 
当本集团预期对金融资产未来现金流量具有不利影响的一项或多项事件发生时，该金融资产成为已发生
信用减值的金融资产。金融资产已发生信用减值的证据包括下列可观察信息： 
 
(1) 
发行方或债务人发生重大财务困难； 
(2) 
债务人违反合同，如偿付利息或本金违约或逾期等； 
(3) 
债权人出于与债务人财务困难有关的经济或合同考虑，给予债务人在任何其他情况下都不会做出
的让步； 
(4) 
债务人很可能破产或进行其他财务重组； 
(5) 
发行方或债务人财务困难导致该金融资产的活跃市场消失； 
(6) 
以大幅折扣购买或源生一项金融资产，该折扣反映了发生信用损失的事实。 
 
11.2.3 预期信用损失的确定 
 
本集团按照下列方法确定相关金融工具的预期信用损失： 
 
 
对于金融资产和租赁应收款，信用损失为本集团应收取的合同现金流量与预期收取的现金流量
之间差额的现值。 
 
对于资产负债表日已发生信用减值但并非购买或源生已发生信用减值的金融资产，信用损失为
该金融资产账面余额与按原实际利率折现的估计未来现金流量的现值之间的差额。 
 
本集团计量金融工具预期信用损失的方法反映的因素包括：通过评价一系列可能的结果而确定的无偏概
率加权平均金额；货币时间价值；在资产负债表日无须付出不必要的额外成本或努力即可获得的有关过
去事项、当前状况以及未来经济状况预测的合理且有依据的信息。 
 
11.2.4 减记金融资产 
 
当本集团不再合理预期金融资产合同现金流量能够全部或部分收回的，直接减记该金融资产的账面余额。
这种减记构成相关金融资产的终止确认。 
 
11.3 
金融资产的转移 
 
满足下列条件之一的金融资产，予以终止确认：(1)收取该金融资产现金流量的合同权利终止；(2)该金融
资产已转移，且将金融资产所有权上几乎所有的风险和报酬转移给转入方；(3)该金融资产已转移，虽然
本集团既没有转移也没有保留金融资产所有权上几乎所有的风险和报酬，但是未保留对该金融资产的控
制。

金融资产的转移 - 续 
 
若本集团既没有转移也没有保留金融资产所有权上几乎所有风险和报酬，且保留了对该金融资产控制的，
则按照其继续涉入被转移金融资产的程度继续确认该被转移金融资产，并相应确认相关负债。本集团按
照下列方式对相关负债进行计量： 
 
 
被转移金融资产以摊余成本计量的，相关负债的账面价值等于继续涉入被转移金融资产的账面
价值减去本集团保留的权利(如果本集团因金融资产转移保留了相关权利)的摊余成本并加上本
集团承担的义务(如果本集团因金融资产转移承担了相关义务)的摊余成本，相关负债不指定为
以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融负债。 
 
被转移金融资产以公允价值计量的，相关负债的账面价值等于继续涉入被转移金融资产的账面
价值减去本集团保留的权利(如果本集团因金融资产转移保留了相关权利)的公允价值并加上本
集团承担的义务(如果本集团因金融资产转移承担了相关义务)的公允价值，该权利和义务的公
允价值应为按独立基础计量时的公允价值。 
 
金融资产整体转移满足终止确认条件的，将所转移金融资产在终止确认日的账面价值及因转移金融资产
而收到的对价与原计入其他综合收益的公允价值变动累计额中对应终止确认部分的金额之和的差额计入
当期损益。若本集团转移的金融资产是指定为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的非交易性权
益工具投资，之前计入其他综合收益的累计利得或损失从其他综合收益中转出，计入留存收益。 
 
金融资产部分转移满足终止确认条件的，将转移前金融资产整体的账面价值在终止确认部分和继续确认
部分之间按照转移日各自的相对公允价值进行分摊，并将终止确认部分收到的对价和原计入其他综合收
益的公允价值变动累计额中对应终止确认部分的金额之和与终止确认部分在终止确认日的账面价值之差
额计入当期损益。若本集团转移的金融资产是指定为以公允价值计量且其变动计入其他综合收益的非交
易性权益工具投资，之前计入其他综合收益的累计利得或损失从其他综合收益中转出，计入留存收益。 
 
金融资产整体转移未满足终止确认条件的，本集团继续确认所转移的金融资产整体，因资产转移而收到
的对价在收到时确认为负债。 
 
11.4 
金融负债和权益工具的分类、确认及计量 
 
本集团根据所发行金融工具的合同条款及其所反映的经济实质而非仅以法律形式，结合金融负债和权益
工具的定义，在初始确认时将该金融工具或其组成部分分类为金融负债或权益工具。 
 
11.4.1 金融负债的分类、确认及计量 
 
金融负债在初始确认时划分为以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的金融负债和其他金融负债。

投资策略，以公允价值为基础对金融负债组合或金融资产和金融负债组合进行管理和业绩评价，并在本
集团内部以此为基础向关键管理人员报告；(3)符合条件的包含嵌入衍生工具的混合合同。 
 
交易性金融负债采用公允价值进行后续计量，公允价值变动形成的利得或损失以及与该等金融负债相关
的股利或利息支出计入当期损益。

除金融资产转移不符合终止确认条件或继续涉入被转移金融资产所形成的金融负债外的其他金融负债分
类为以摊余成本计量的金融负债，按摊余成本进行后续计量，终止确认或摊销产生的利得或损失计入当
期损益。 
 
本集团与交易对手方修改或重新议定合同，未导致按摊余成本进行后续计量的金融负债终止确认，但导
致合同现金流量发生变化的，本集团重新计算该金融负债的账面价值，并将相关利得或损失计入当期损
益。重新计算的该金融负债的账面价值，本集团根据将重新议定或修改的合同现金流量按金融负债的原
实际利率折现的现值确定。对于修改或重新议定合同所产生的所有成本或费用，本集团调整修改后的金
融负债的账面价值，并在修改后金融负债的剩余期限内进行摊销。 
 
11.4.2 金融负债的终止确认 
 
金融负债的现时义务全部或部分已经解除的，终止确认该金融负债或其一部分。本集团(借入方)与借出
方之间签订协议，以承担新金融负债方式替换原金融负债，且新金融负债与原金融负债的合同条款实质
上不同的，本集团终止确认原金融负债，并同时确认新金融负债。  
 
金融负债全部或部分终止确认的，将终止确认部分的账面价值与支付的对价(包括转出的非现金资产或承
担的新金融负债)之间的差额，计入当期损益。

存货 
 
16.1  
存货类别、发出计价方法、盘存制度、低值易耗品和包装物的摊销方法  
 
16.1.1 存货类别  
 
本集团的存货主要包括产成品、在产品、原材料及合同履约成本。存货按成本进行初始计量，存货成本
包括采购成本、加工成本和其他使存货达到目前场所和状态所发生的支出。 
 
16.1.2 发出存货的计价方法 
 
存货发出时，采用移动加权平均法确定发出存货的实际成本。 
 
16.1.3 存货的盘存制度 
 
存货盘存制度为永续盘存制。 
 
16.1.4 低值易耗品和包装物的摊销方法 
 
包装物和低值易耗品采用一次转销法进行摊销。 
 
16.2  
存货跌价准备的确认标准和计提方法 
 
资产负债表日，存货按照成本与可变现净值孰低计量。当其可变现净值低于成本时，提取存货跌价准备。 
 
可变现净值是指在日常活动中，存货的估计售价减去至完工时估计将要发生的成本、估计的销售费用以
及相关税费后的金额。在确定存货的可变现净值时，以取得的确凿证据为基础，同时考虑持有存货的目
的以及资产负债表日后事项的影响。 
 
计提存货跌价准备后，如果以前减记存货价值的影响因素已经消失，导致存货的可变现净值高于其账面
价值的，在原已计提的存货跌价准备金额内予以转回，转回的金额计入当期损益。 
 
16.3    按照组合计提存货跌价准备的组合类别及确定依据、不同类别存货可变现净值的确定依据 
 
本集团对于数量繁多、单价较低的存货，按存货类别计提存货跌价准备；对与在同一地区生产和销售的
产品系列相关、具有相同或类似最终用途或目的，且难以与其他项目分开计量的存货，合并计提存货跌
价准备；本集团根据存货性质和状态分组计提存货跌价准备。

17.2 合同资产的预期信用损失的确定方法及会计处理方法  
 
与应收账款一致，除对单项金额重大且债务人发生重大财务困难的合同资产单独评估信用风险，本集团
对其他合同资产在组合基础上确定合同资产的信用损失。本年度合同资产预期信用损失准备的增加或转
回金额，作为减值损失或利得计入当期损益。  
  
17.3 按照信用风险特征组合计提坏账准备的组合类别及确定依据  
 
与应收账款一致，本集团以共同风险特征为依据，按组合计提信用损失准备。本集团采用的共同信用风
险特征包括业务的区域和对象。 
 
18. 
长期股权投资 
 
18.1  
共同控制、重要影响的判断标准 
 
控制是指投资方拥有对被投资方的权力，通过参与被投资方的相关活动而享有可变回报，并且有能力运
用对被投资方的权力影响其回报金额。共同控制是指按照相关约定对某项安排所共有的控制，并且该安
排的相关活动必须经过分享控制权的参与方一致同意后才能决策。重大影响是指对被投资方的财务和经
营政策有参与决策的权力，但并不能够控制或者与其他方一起共同控制这些政策的制定。在确定能否对
被投资单位实施控制或施加重大影响时，已考虑投资方和其他方持有的被投资单位当期可转换公司债券、
当期可执行认股权证等潜在表决权因素。 
 
18.2  
初始投资成本的确定 
 
对于同一控制下的企业合并取得的长期股权投资，在合并日按照被合并方所有者权益在最终控制方合并
财务报表中的账面价值的份额作为长期股权投资的初始投资成本。长期股权投资初始投资成本与支付的
现金、转让的非现金资产以及所承担债务账面价值之间的差额，调整资本公积；资本公积不足冲减的，
调整留存收益。以发行权益性证券作为合并对价的，在合并日按照被合并方所有者权益在最终控制方合
并财务报表中的账面价值的份额作为长期股权投资的初始投资成本，按照发行股份的面值总额作为股本，
长期股权投资初始投资成本与所发行股份面值总额之间的差额，调整资本公积；资本公积不足冲减的，
调整留存收益。 
 
对于非同一控制下的企业合并取得的长期股权投资，在购买日按照合并成本作为长期股权投资的初始投
资成本。通过多次交易分步取得被购买方的股权，最终形成非同一控制下的企业合并的，分别是否属于
“一揽子交易”进行处理：属于“一揽子交易”的，将各项交易作为一项取得控制权的交易进行会计处理。
不属于“一揽子交易”的，按照原持有被购买方的股权投资账面价值加上新增投资成本之和，作为改按成
本法核算的长期股权投资的初始投资成本。原持有的股权采用权益法核算的，相关其他综合收益暂不进
行会计处理。 
 
合并方或购买方为企业合并发生的审计、法律服务、评估咨询等中介费用以及其他相关管理费用，于发
生时计入当期损益。 
 
除企业合并形成的长期股权投资外其他方式取得的长期股权投资，按成本进行初始计量。

后续计量及损益确认方法 
 
18.3.1  按成本法核算的长期股权投资 
 
公司财务报表采用成本法核算对子公司的长期股权投资。子公司是指本集团能够对其实施控制的被投资
主体。 
 
采用成本法核算的长期股权投资按初始投资成本计量。追加或收回投资调整长期股权投资的成本。当期
投资收益按照享有被投资单位宣告发放的现金股利或利润确认。 
 
18.3.2  按权益法核算的长期股权投资 
 
除全部或部分分类为持有待售资产的对联营企业和合营企业的投资外，本集团对联营企业和合营企业的
投资采用权益法核算。联营企业是指本集团能够对其施加重大影响的被投资单位，合营企业是指本集团
仅对该安排的净资产享有权利的合营安排。 
 
采用权益法核算时，长期股权投资的初始投资成本大于投资时应享有被投资单位可辨认净资产公允价值
份额的，不调整长期股权投资的初始投资成本；初始投资成本小于投资时应享有被投资单位可辨认净资
产公允价值份额的，其差额计入当期损益，同时调整长期股权投资的成本。 
 
采用权益法核算时，按照应享有或应分担的被投资单位实现的净损益和其他综合收益的份额，分别确认
投资收益和其他综合收益，同时调整长期股权投资的账面价值；按照被投资单位宣告分派的利润或现金
股利计算应享有的部分，相应减少长期股权投资的账面价值；对于被投资单位除净损益、其他综合收益
和利润分配以外所有者权益的其他变动，调整长期股权投资的账面价值并计入资本公积。在确认应享有
被投资单位净损益的份额时，以取得投资时被投资单位各项可辨认资产等的公允价值为基础，对被投资
单位的净利润进行调整后确认。被投资单位采用的会计政策及会计期间与本公司不一致的，按照本公司
的会计政策及会计期间对被投资单位的财务报表进行调整，并据以确认投资收益和其他综合收益。对于
本集团与联营企业及合营企业之间发生的交易，投出或出售的资产不构成业务的，未实现内部交易损益
按照享有的比例计算归属于本集团的部分予以抵销，在此基础上确认投资损益。但本集团与被投资单位
发生的未实现内部交易损失，属于所转让资产减值损失的，不予以抵销。 
 
在确认应分担被投资单位发生的净亏损时，以长期股权投资的账面价值和其他实质上构成对被投资单位
净投资的长期权益减记至零为限。此外，如本集团对被投资单位负有承担额外损失的义务，则按预计承
担的义务确认预计负债，计入当期投资损失。被投资单位以后期间实现净利润的，本集团在收益分享额
弥补未确认的亏损分担额后，恢复确认收益分享额。 
 
18.4  
长期股权投资处置 
 
处置长期股权投资时，其账面价值与实际取得价款的差额，计入当期损益。

23. 
长期资产减值 
 
本集团在每一个资产负债表日检查长期股权投资、固定资产、在建工程、使用权资产及使用寿命确定的
无形资产是否存在可能发生减值的迹象。如果该等资产存在减值迹象，则估计其可收回金额。使用寿命
不确定的无形资产和尚未达到可使用状态的无形资产，无论是否存在减值迹象，每年均进行减值测试。 
 
估计资产的可收回金额以单项资产为基础，如果难以对单项资产的可收回金额进行估计的，则以该资产
所属的资产组为基础确定资产组的可收回金额。可收回金额为资产或者资产组的公允价值减去处置费用
后的净额与其预计未来现金流量的现值两者之中的较高者。 
 
如果资产的可收回金额低于其账面价值，按其差额计提资产减值准备，并计入当期损益。 
 
商誉至少在每年年度终了进行减值测试。对商誉进行减值测试时，结合与其相关的资产组或者资产组组
合进行。即，自购买日起将商誉的账面价值按照合理的方法分摊到能够从企业合并的协同效应中受益的
资产组或资产组组合，如包含分摊的商誉的资产组或资产组组合的可收回金额低于其账面价值的，确认
相应的减值损失。减值损失金额首先抵减分摊到该资产组或资产组组合的商誉的账面价值，再根据资产
组或资产组组合中除商誉以外的其他各项资产的账面价值所占比重，按比例抵减其他各项资产的账面价
值。 
 
上述资产减值损失一经确认，在以后会计期间不予转回。 
 
24. 
长期待摊费用 
 
长期待摊费用为已经发生但应由本年和以后各期负担的分摊期限在一年以上的各项费用，主要为租入固

本集团在职工为其提供服务的会计期间，将实际发生的短期薪酬确认为负债，并计入当期损益或相关资
产成本。本集团发生的职工福利费，在实际发生时根据实际发生额计入当期损益或相关资产成本。职工
福利费为非货币性福利的，按照公允价值计量。 
 
本集团为职工缴纳的医疗保险费、工伤保险费、生育保险费等社会保险费和住房公积金，以及本集团按
规定提取的工会经费和职工教育经费，在职工为本集团提供服务的会计期间，根据规定的计提基础和计
提比例计算确定相应的职工薪酬金额，确认相应负债，并计入当期损益或相关资产成本。 
 
26.2 
离职后福利的会计处理方法 
 
离职后福利全部为设定提存计划。 
 
本集团在职工为其提供服务的会计期间，将根据设定提存计划计算的应缴存金额确认为负债，并计入当
期损益或相关资产成本。 
 
26.3 
辞退福利的会计处理方法 
 
本集团向职工提供辞退福利的，在下列两者孰早日确认辞退福利产生的职工薪酬负债，并计入当期损益：
本集团不能单方面撤回因解除劳动关系计划或裁减建议所提供的辞退福利时；本集团确认与涉及支付辞
退福利的重组相关的成本或费用时。 
 
27. 
预计负债 
 
当与产品质量保证等或有事项相关的义务是本集团承担的现时义务，且履行该义务很可能导致经济利益
流出，以及该义务的金额能够可靠地计量，则确认为预计负债。 
 
在资产负债表日，考虑与或有事项有关的风险、不确定性和货币时间价值等因素，按照履行相关现时义
务所需支出的最佳估计数对预计负债进行计量。如果货币时间价值影响重大，则以预计未来现金流出折
现后的金额确定最佳估计数。 
 
本集团根据预计索赔率以及维修和更换成本等估计产品质量保证金。 
 
28. 
股份支付 
 
本集团的股份支付是为了获取职工提供服务而授予权益工具或者承担以权益工具为基础确定的负债的交
易。本集团的股份支付为以权益结算的股份支付。 
 
28.1 
以权益结算的股份支付 
 
对于用以换取职工提供的服务的权益结算的股份支付，本集团以授予职工权益工具在授予日的公允价值
计量。该公允价值的金额在等待期内以对可行权权益工具数量的最佳估计为基础，按直线法计算计入相
关成本或费用，相应增加资本公积。 
 
在等待期内每个资产负债表日，本集团根据最新取得的可行权职工人数变动等后续信息做出最佳估计，
修正预计可行权的权益工具数量。上述估计的影响计入当期相关成本或费用，并相应调整资本公积。

实施、修改、终止股份支付计划的相关会计处理 
 
本集团对股份支付计划进行修改时，若修改增加了所授予权益工具的公允价值，按照权益工具公允价值
的增加相应确认取得服务的增加；若修改增加了所授予权益工具的数量，则将增加的权益工具的公允价
值相应地确认为取得服务的增加。权益工具公允价值的增加是指修改前后的权益工具在修改日的公允价
值之间的差额。若修改减少了股份支付公允价值总额或采用了其他不利于职工的方式修改股份支付计划
的条款和条件，则仍继续对取得的服务进行会计处理，视同该变更从未发生，除非本集团取消了部分或
全部已授予的权益工具。 
 
在等待期内，如果取消了授予的权益工具，本集团对取消所授予的权益性工具作为加速行权处理，将剩
余等待期内应确认的金额立即计入当期损益，同时确认资本公积。职工能够选择满足非可行权条件但在
等待期内未满足的，本集团将其作为授予权益工具的取消处理。 
 
29. 
收入 
 
本集团的收入为产品销售收入、工程施工收入和云服务及其他服务收入。 
 
本集团在履行了合同中的履约义务，即在客户取得相关商品或服务控制权时，按照分摊至该项履约义务
的交易价格确认收入。履约义务，是指合同中本集团向客户转让可明确区分商品或服务的承诺。 
 
本集团在合同开始日对合同进行评估，识别该合同所包含的各单项履约义务，并确定各单项履约义务是
在某一时段内履行，还是在某一时点履行。满足下列条件之一的，属于在某一时间段内履行的履约义务，
本集团按照履约进度，在一段时间内确认收入：(1)客户在本集团履约的同时即取得并消耗所带来的经济
利益；(2)客户能够控制本集团履约过程中在建的商品；(3)本集团履约过程中所产出的商品具有不可替代
用途，且本集团在整个合同期间内有权就累计至今已完成的履约部分收取款项。否则，本集团在客户取
得相关商品或服务控制权的时点确认收入。 
 
合同中包含两项或多项履约义务的，本集团在合同开始日，按照各单项履约义务所承诺商品或服务的单
独售价的相对比例，将交易价格分摊至各单项履约义务。但在有确凿证据表明合同折扣或可变对价仅与
合同中一项或多项(而非全部)履约义务相关的，本集团将该合同折扣或可变对价分摊至相关一项或多项
履约义务。单独售价，是指本集团向客户单独销售商品或服务的价格。单独售价无法直接观察的，本集
团综合考虑能够合理取得的全部相关信息，并最大限度地采用可观察的输入值估计单独售价。 
 
本集团根据在向客户转让商品或服务前是否拥有对该服务的控制权，来判断从事交易时本集团的身份是
主要责任人还是代理人。本集团在向客户转让商品或服务前能够控制该商品或服务的，本集团为主要责
任人，按照已收或应收对价总额确认收入；否则，本集团为代理人，按照预期有权收取的佣金或手续费
的金额确认收入，该金额按照已收或应收对价总额扣除应支付给其他相关方的价款后的净额或者按照既
定的佣金金额或比例等确定。

本集团根据合同规定，在产品的控制权转移时，即产品交给约定的承运人或者运送至对方指定地点经过
签收时确认收入。由于产品交付给客户代表了取得无条件收取合同对价的权利，款项的到期仅取决于时
间流逝，故本集团在产品交付给客户时确认一项应收款。当客户预付货款时，本集团将收到的交易金额
确认为一项合同负债，直至产品被交付予客户时确认收入。 
 
本集团与经销商的产品销售合同中存在可变对价。本集团按照预期交付产品的时间、数量及价格等确定
可变对价的最佳估计数。包含可变对价的交易价格，不超过在相关不确定性消除时累计已确认收入极可
能不会发生重大转回的金额。每一资产负债表日，本集团重新估计应计入交易价格的可变对价金额。 
 
本集团向经销商销售产品时提供了销售激励措施的额外购买选择权，即本集团经销商在向本集团购买特
定产品时可以积累销售返点，并在未来购买商品时用其抵扣价款。这些销售返点向经销商在其未来购买
商品时提供了同类客户无法享有的折扣。因此，向经销商提供该未来采购款的抵扣的承诺是一项单独的
履约义务，在销售交易发生时该承诺按根据返点公允价值分摊到的交易价格确认为一项合同负债，在经
销商使用销售返点抵扣价款时确认收入。 
 
本集团为出售的产品提供质量保证，与本集团销售产品相关的质量保证不能单独购买，是向客户保证所
销售的产品符合既定标准，因此本集团按照《企业会计准则第13 号——或有事项》的规定进行会计处
理。 
 
本集团的产品销售附有销售退回条款，本集团在客户取得相关产品控制权时按照因向客户转让产品而预
期有权收取的对价金额(即，不包含预期因销售退回将退还的金额)确认收入，按照预期因销售退回将退
还的金额确认负债；同时，按照预期将退回产品转让时的账面价值，扣除收回该产品预计发生的成本(包
括退回产品的价值减损)后的余额，确认为一项资产，按照所转让产品转让时的账面价值，扣除上述资产
成本的净额结转成本。 
 
本集团的部分产品销售合同存在分期收款条款，合同中存在重大融资成分。本集团按照假定客户在取得
产品控制权时即以现金支付的应付金额确定交易价格。该交易价格与合同对价之间的差额，在合同期间
内采用实际利率法摊销。合同开始日，本集团预计客户取得产品控制权与客户支付价款间隔不超过一年
的，不考虑合同中存在的重大融资成分。 
 
29.2 
工程施工收入 
 
工程施工收入系本集团提供的与智能安防解决方案项目及PPP 项目相关的建造合同收入。 
 
对于工程施工，客户能够控制本集团履约过程中的在建资产，本集团将其作为在某一时段内履行的履约
义务，根据履约进度确认收入，履约进度不能合理确定的除外。 
 
本集团采用产出法确定履约进度，即根据已转移给客户的工程施工服务对于客户的价值确定履约进度。
对于履约进度不能合理确定时，本集团已经发生的成本预计能够得到补偿的，按照已经发生的成本金额
确认收入，直到履约进度能够合理确定为止。

对于云服务及其他服务，客户在本集团履约的同时即取得并消耗所带来的经济利益，本集团将其作为某
一段内履行的履约义务，在提供服务的期限内按照履约进度确认收入。本集团采用产出法确定履约进度，
即根据已转移给客户的服务对于客户的价值确定履约进度。客户在购买时预先支付了云服务款，因此本
集团在交易时将收到的云服务款确认一项合同负债，并在提供服务的期间内按照履约进度确认收入。本

租赁 
 
租赁，是指在一定期间内，出租人将资产的使用权让与承租人以获取对价的合同。 
 
在合同开始日，本集团评估该合同是否为租赁或者包含租赁。除非合同条款和条件发生变化，本集团不
重新评估合同是否为租赁或者包含租赁。 
 
32.1 
本集团作为承租人 
 
32.1.1 租赁的分拆 
 
合同中同时包含一项或多项租赁和非租赁部分的，本集团将各项单独租赁和非租赁部分进行分拆，按照
各租赁部分单独价格及非租赁部分的单独价格之和的相对比例分摊合同对价。 
 
32.1.2 使用权资产 
 
除短期租赁和低价值资产租赁外，本集团在租赁期开始日对租赁确认使用权资产。租赁期开始日，是指
出租人提供租赁资产使其可供本集团使用的起始日期。使用权资产按照成本进行初始计量。该成本包括： 
 
 
租赁负债的初始计量金额； 
 
在租赁期开始日或之前支付的租赁付款额，存在租赁激励的，扣除已享受的租赁激励相关金
额； 
 
本集团发生的初始直接费用； 
 
本集团为拆卸及移除租赁资产、复原租赁资产所在场地或将租赁资产恢复至租赁条款约定状态
预计将发生的成本，不包括属于为生产存货而发生的成本。 
 
本集团参照《企业会计准则第4 号——固定资产》有关折旧规定，对使用权资产计提折旧。本集团能够
合理确定租赁期届满时取得租赁资产所有权的，使用权资产在租赁资产剩余使用寿命内计提折旧。无法
合理确定租赁期届满时能够取得租赁资产所有权的，在租赁期与租赁资产剩余使用寿命两者孰短的期间
内计提折旧。 
 
本集团按照《企业会计准则第8 号——资产减值》的规定来确定使用权资产是否已发生减值，并对已识
别的减值损失进行会计处理。 
 
32.1.3 租赁负债 
 
除短期租赁和低价值资产租赁外，本集团在租赁期开始日按照该日尚未支付的租赁付款额的现值对租赁
负债进行初始计量。在计算租赁付款额的现值时，本集团采用租赁内含利率作为折现率，无法确定租赁
内含利率的，采用增量借款利率作为折现率。 
 
租赁付款额是指本集团向出租人支付的与在租赁期内使用租赁资产的权利相关的款项，包括： 
 
 
固定付款额及实质固定付款额，存在租赁激励的，扣除租赁激励相关金额； 
 
本集团合理确定将行使的购买选择权的行权价格； 
 
租赁期反映出本集团将行使终止租赁选择权的，行使终止租赁选择权需支付的款项； 
 
根据本集团提供的担保余值预计应支付的款项。 
 
租赁期开始日后，本集团按照固定的周期性利率计算租赁负债在租赁期内各期间的利息费用，并计入当
期损益或相关资产成本。

资产的账面价值已调减至零，但租赁负债仍需进一步调减的，本集团将差额计入当期损益： 
 
 
因租赁期变化或购买选择权的评估结果发生变化的，本集团按变动后租赁付款额和修订后的折
现率计算的现值重新计量租赁负债； 
 
根据担保余值预计的应付金额发生变动，本集团按照变动后的租赁付款额和原折现率计算的现
值重新计量租赁负债。 
 
32.1.4 作为承租方对短期租赁和低价值资产租赁进行简化处理的判断依据和会计处理方法 
 
本集团对短期租赁以及低价值资产租赁选择不确认使用权资产和租赁负债。短期租赁，是指在租赁期开
始日，租赁期不超过12 个月且不包含购买选择权的租赁。低价值资产租赁，是指单项租赁资产为全新
资产时价值较低的租赁。本集团将短期租赁和低价值资产租赁的租赁付款额，在租赁期内各个期间按照
直线法计入当期损益或相关资产成本。 
 
32.1.5 租赁变更 
 
租赁发生变更且同时符合下列条件的，本集团将该租赁变更作为一项单独租赁进行会计处理： 
 
 
该租赁变更通过增加一项或多项租赁资产的使用权而扩大了租赁范围； 
 
增加的对价与租赁范围扩大部分的单独价格按该合同情况调整后的金额相当。 
 
租赁变更未作为一项单独租赁进行会计处理的，在租赁变更生效日，本集团重新分摊变更后合同的对价，
重新确定租赁期，并按照变更后租赁付款额和修订后的折现率计算的现值重新计量租赁负债。 
 
租赁变更导致租赁范围缩小或租赁期缩短的，本集团相应调减使用权资产的账面价值，并将部分终止或
完全终止租赁的相关利得或损失计入当期损益。其他租赁变更导致租赁负债重新计量的，本集团相应调
整使用权资产的账面价值。

32.2.2.2 本集团作为出租人记录融资租赁业务 
 
于租赁期开始日，本集团以租赁投资净额作为应收融资租赁款的入账价值，并终止确认融资租赁资产。 
租赁投资净额为未担保余值和租赁期开始日尚未收到的租赁收款额按照租赁内含利率折现的现值之和。 
 
租赁收款额，是指本集团因让渡在租赁期内使用租赁资产的权利而应向承租人收取的款项，包括： 
 
 
承租人需支付的固定付款额及实质固定付款额，存在租赁激励的，扣除租赁激励相关金额； 
 
购买选择权的行权价格，前提是合理确定承租人将行使该选择权； 
 
承租人行使终止租赁选择权需支付的款项，前提是租赁期反映出承租人将行使终止租赁选择
权； 


赁收款额按市场利率折现的现值两者孰低确认收入，并按照租赁资产账面价值扣除未担保余值的现值后
的余额结转销售成本。 
 
本集团以生产商或经销商作为出租人为取得融资租赁发生的成本，在租赁期开始日计入当期损益。 
 
32.2.3 租赁变更 
 
经营租赁发生变更的，本集团自变更生效日起将其作为一项新租赁进行会计处理，与变更前租赁有关的
预收或应收租赁收款额视为新租赁的收款额。 
 
融资租赁发生变更且同时符合下列条件的，本集团将该变更作为一项单独租赁进行会计处理： 
 
 
该变更通过增加一项或多项租赁资产的使用权而扩大了租赁范围； 
 
增加的对价与租赁范围扩大部分的单独价格按该合同情况调整后的金额相当。 
 
融资租赁的变更未作为一项单独租赁进行会计处理的，本集团分别下列情形对变更后的租赁进行处理： 
 
 
假如变更在租赁开始日生效，该租赁会被分类为经营租赁的，本集团自租赁变更生效日开始将
其作为一项新租赁进行会计处理，并以租赁变更生效日前的租赁投资净额作为租赁资产的账面
价值； 
 
假如变更在租赁开始日生效，该租赁会被分类为融资租赁的，本集团按照《企业会计准则第22

递延所得税资产 / 递延所得税负债 
 
所得税费用包括当期所得税和递延所得税。

当期所得税 
 
资产负债表日，对于当期和以前期间形成的当期所得税负债(或资产)，以按照税法规定计算的预期应交
纳(或返还)的所得税金额计量。 
 
33.2 
递延所得税资产及递延所得税负债 
 
对于某些资产、负债项目的账面价值与其计税基础之间的差额，以及未作为资产和负债确认但按照税法
规定可以确定其计税基础的项目的账面价值与计税基础之间的差额产生的暂时性差异，采用资产负债表
债务法确认递延所得税资产及递延所得税负债。 
 
一般情况下所有暂时性差异均确认相关的递延所得税。但对于可抵扣暂时性差异，本集团以很可能取得 
用来抵扣可抵扣暂时性差异的应纳税所得额为限，确认相关的递延所得税资产。此外，与商誉的初始确 
认相关的，以及与既不是企业合并、发生时也不影响会计利润和应纳税所得额(或可抵扣亏损)且不导致 
等额应纳税暂时性差异和可抵扣暂时性差异的交易中产生的资产或负债的初始确认有关的暂时性差异， 
不予确认有关的递延所得税资产或负债。 
 
对于能够结转以后年度的可抵扣亏损及税款抵减，以很可能获得用来抵扣可抵扣亏损和税款抵减的未来
应纳税所得额为限，确认相应的递延所得税资产。 
 
本集团确认与子公司投资相关的应纳税暂时性差异产生的递延所得税负债，除非本集团能够控制暂时性
差异转回的时间，而且该暂时性差异在可预见的未来很可能不会转回。对于与子公司投资相关的可抵扣
暂时性差异，只有当暂时性差异在可预见的未来很可能转回，且未来很可能获得用来抵扣可抵扣暂时性
差异的应纳税所得额时，本集团才确认递延所得税资产。 
 
资产负债表日，对于递延所得税资产和递延所得税负债，根据税法规定，按照预期收回相关资产或清偿
相关负债期间的适用税率计量。 
 
除与直接计入其他综合收益或股东权益的交易和事项相关的当期所得税和递延所得税计入其他综合收益
或股东权益，以及企业合并产生的递延所得税调整商誉的账面价值外，其余当期所得税和递延所得税费
用或收益计入当期损益。 
 
资产负债表日，对递延所得税资产的账面价值进行复核，如果未来很可能无法获得足够的应纳税所得额
用以抵扣递延所得税资产的利益，则减记递延所得税资产的账面价值。在很可能获得足够的应纳税所得
额时，减记的金额予以转回。

运用会计政策过程中所作的重要判断和会计估计所采用的关键假设和不确定因素 
 
本集团在运用附注(三)所描述的会计政策过程中，由于经营活动内在的不确定性，本集团需要对无法准
确计量的报表项目的账面价值进行判断、估计和假设。这些判断、估计和假设是基于本集团管理层过去
的历史经验，并在考虑其他相关因素的基础上作出的。实际的结果可能与本集团的估计存在差异。 
 
本集团对前述判断、估计和假设在持续经营的基础上进行定期复核，会计估计的变更仅影响变更当期的，
其影响数在变更当期予以确认；既影响变更当期又影响未来期间的，其影响数在变更当期和未来期间予
以确认。 
 
- 会计估计所采用的关键假设和不确定因素 
 
资产负债表日，会计估计中很可能导致未来期间资产、负债账面价值作出重大调整的关键假设和不确定
性主要有： 
 
存货跌价准备 
 
除合同履约成本外，存货按照成本与可变现净值孰低计量。对于原材料，以最近或期后的实际采购价格
作为确定可变现净值的依据；对于在产品，以最近或期后同类产成品的实际售价减去当期同类在产品至
完工时估计将要发生的成本、估计将要发生的销售费用及相关税费后的金额作为确定可变现净值的依据；
对于产成品，以最近或期后产成品的实际售价减去估计将要发生的销售费用及相关税费后的金额作为确
定可变现净值的依据。本集团会定期对存货进行全面盘点来确定是否存在残次、过时或呆滞的存货并复
核其减值情况，此外，本集团管理层会定期根据存货库龄复核长库龄存货的减值情况。基于上述程序，
本集团管理层认为已对存货提取了足额的跌价准备，具体情况详见附注(五)、9。 
 
应收账款的减值 
 
除在单项资产的基础上确定其信用损失的应收账款，本集团在组合基础上采用减值矩阵确定相关应收账
款的预期信用损失。本集团按照业务的区域和对象划分风险特征，将相关应收账款分为不同组合，基于
历史损失率并考虑合理且有依据的行业前瞻性信息对不同组合的各类应收账款确定相应的损失准备的比
例。于2023年12月31日，本集团基于历史损失率并考虑合理且有依据的前瞻性信息对应收账款确定相应
的损失准备的比例。该预期信用损失准备的金额将随本集团的估计而发生变化。本集团的应收账款的预
期信用损失准备的具体情况详见附注(五)、4。 
 
固定资产的使用寿命及预计净残值 
 
本集团对固定资产可使用寿命的估计是根据对类似性质及功能的固定资产实际可使用年限的历史经验为
基础，对预计净残值的估计是根据假定固定资产预计使用寿命已满并处于使用寿命终了时的预期状态，
本集团目前从该项资产处置中获得的扣除预计处置费用后的金额。本集团至少于每年年度终了对固定资
产的预计使用寿命及预计净残值进行复核，本年度本集团管理层未发现使本集团固定资产使用寿命缩短
或延长及需要改变预计净残值的情况。

- 会计估计所采用的关键假设和不确定因素 - 续 
 
产品质量保证预计负债 
 
产品质量保证预计负债是基于产品合同中向客户保证所销售商品符合既定标准的质量保证义务所需承担
的成本费用，本集团根据预计的相关产品索赔率、维修和更换成本作出估计。管理层认为目前的产品质
量保证预计负债的估计是合理的，但本集团将继续检视产品返修情况，一旦有迹象表明需要调整相关会
计估计的假设，本集团将在有关迹象发生的期间进行调整。 
 
递延所得税资产和递延所得税负债 
 
递延所得税资产和递延所得税负债按照预期收回相关资产或清偿相关债务期间的适用所得税税率计量。
预期适用所得税税率是根据有关现行的税务法规及本集团的实际情况而确定。若预期所得税税率与原估
计有差异，本集团管理层将对其进行调整。 
 
递延所得税资产的实现主要取决于未来的实际应纳税所得额和应纳税暂时性差异，以及暂时性差异在未
来使用年度的实际税率。如未来实际产生的应纳税所得额和应纳税暂时性差异少于预期，或实际税率低
于预期，确认的递延所得税资产将被转回，确认在转回发生期间的损益表中。如未来实际产生的应纳税
所得额和应纳税暂时性差异多于预期，或实际税率高于预期，将确认部分未确认的可抵扣亏损和可抵扣
暂时性差异的递延所得税资产，确认在该情况发生期间的损益表中。

商誉的减值准备 
 
本集团在年末对商誉进行减值测试时，采用的关键假设及其依据如下：  
 
包含分摊的商誉的资产组组合的可收回金额按照相关资产组组合预计未来现金流量的现值确定。其未来
现金流量的预测期年限均为5 年。未来现金流量的预计是管理层基于过去的业绩和对市场发展的预期所
估计的预计期间的销售收入和销售成本、经营费用后得出的。超过5 年的现金流量增长率为0-2%。 
 
本年度本集团未发现包含分摊的商誉的相关资产组组合的可收回金额低于其账面价值的情况，故认为无
需对商誉计提减值损失。

1、 
风险管理目标、政策和程序，以及本期发生的变化 
 
本集团从事风险管理的目标是在风险和收益之间取得适当的平衡，将风险对本集团经营业绩的负面影响
降低到最低水平，使股东及其其他权益投资者的利益最大化。基于该风险管理目标，本集团风险管理的
基本策略是确定和分析本集团所面临的各种风险，建立适当的风险承受底线和进行风险管理，并及时可
靠地对各种风险进行监督，将风险控制在限定的范围之内。 
 
1.1 
市场风险 
 
1.1.1 外汇风险 
 
外汇风险指因汇率变动产生损失的风险。本集团承受外汇风险主要与美元、欧元等货币有关。本集团位
于中国大陆境内的公司主要以人民币、美元、欧元进行采购、销售及融资活动，其他主要业务活动以人
民币计价结算；本集团位于中国香港地区和中国境外的子公司主要以美元、欧元等当地货币进行采购、
销售、融资及其他主要业务活动。 
 
于本年末，除附注(五)、62 所述外币货币性项目外，本集团的资产及负债主要为以各子公司的记账本位
币计价结算。在外币货币性项目中，下表所述美元和欧元余额(已折算为人民币)的资产和负债产生的外
汇风险可能对本集团的经营业绩产生重大影响。

1.1.2 利率风险 
 
本集团因利率变动引起金融工具现金流量变动的风险主要与浮动利率银行借款(详见附注(五)、34))及浮
动利率银行存款有关。本集团因利率变动引起金融工具公允价值变动的风险主要与固定利率银行借款(详
见附注(五)、24 及附注(五)、34)及固定利率银行存款有关。

市场风险 - 续 
 
1.1.2 利率风险 - 续 
 
本集团根据当时的市场环境来决定固定利率及浮动利率借款合同的相对比例。于2023 年12 月31 日，本
集团固定利率的长短期带息债务合计为人民币11,105,877,902.09 元(2022 年12 月31 日：人民币
9,106,539,532.31 元) (附注(五)、24 及附注(五)、34)，浮动利率的长短期带息债务合计为人民币
5,546,156,677.17 元(2022 年12 月31 日：人民币2,262,287,174.62 元) (附注(五)、34)。 
 
本集团目前并无利率互换等安排，将持续密切关注借款利率变动对于本集团利率风险的影响，并会依据
最新的市场情况及时做出调整。 
 
本集团预期浮动利率银行存款产生的现金流量风险敞口和固定利率银行存款产生的公允价值变动的风险
敞口均不重大。 
 
1.1.3 其他价格风险 
 
本集团的价格风险主要产生于交易性权益工具投资及衍生金融工具。交易性权益工具投资全部为非上市
交易性权益工具投资。 
 
本集团因持有以公允价值计量的金融资产而面临价格风险。由于某些金融工具的公允价值是按照未来现
金流量折现法为基础的通用定价模型或其他估值技术确定的，而估值技术本身基于一定的估值假设。因
此估值结果对估值假设具有重大的敏感性。但本集团年末交易性权益工具投资及衍生金融工具金额不重
大，改变估值假设引起金融工具价格变动的影响金额不重大，因此不进行敏感性分析。 
 
1.2 
信用风险 
 
2023 年12 月31 日，可能引起本集团财务损失的最大信用风险敞口主要来自于合同另一方未能履行义务
而导致本集团金融资产产生的损失，具体包括：货币资金(附注(五)、1)、应收票据(附注(五)、3)、应收账
款(附注(五)、4)、应收款项融资(附注(五)、6)、其他应收款(附注(五)、8)、合同资产(附注(五)、5 及附注
(五)、22)、一年内到期的非流动资产(附注(五)、10)、长期应收款(附注(五)、12)等，以及未纳入减值评估
范围的以公允价值计量且其变动计入当期损益的衍生金融资产(附注(五)、2)。于资产负债表日，本集团
金融资产的账面价值已代表其最大信用风险敞口。 
 
为降低信用风险，本集团已安排专门团队确定信用额度、进行信用审批，并执行其他监控程序以确保采
取必要的措施回收逾期债务。此外，本集团于每个资产负债表日审核金融资产的回收情况，以确保对相
关金融资产计提了充分的信用损失准备。因此，本集团管理层认为本集团所承担的信用风险已经大为降
低。 
 
本集团的货币资金存放在信用评级较高的银行，故货币资金只具有较低的信用风险。 
 
对于应收账款、合同资产和长期应收款，本集团设定相关政策以控制信用风险敞口。本集团基于对客户
的财务状况、从第三方获取担保的可能性、信用记录及其他因素诸如目前市场状况等评估客户的信用资
质并设置相应信用期。本集团会定期对客户的信用记录进行监控，对于信用记录不良的客户，本集团会
采用书面催款、缩短信用期或取消信用期等方式，以确保本集团的整体信用风险在可控的范围内。对于
应收账款、合同资产及与融资租赁及分期收款业务相关的长期应收款，本集团按照简化方法，即按照相
当于整个存续期内预期信用损失的金额计量损失准备，相关预期信用损失计量详见(附注(五)、4 及附注
(五)、5)。对于剩余的长期应收款，本集团根据违约风险敞口按未来12 个月或整个存续期内的预期信用
损失率，计算预期信用损失，相关预期信用损失计量详见(附注(五)、12)。

1.2 
信用风险 - 续 
 
对于应收银行承兑汇票和应收款项融资，由于承兑方主要为信用评级较高的银行，故本集团认为其不存
在重大的信用风险，不会产生因对方单位违约而导致的任何重大损失。对于应收财务公司承兑汇票和商
业承兑汇票，本集团设定相关政策以控制信用风险敞口。本集团基于对承兑方的财务状况、信用记录及
其他因素诸如目前市场状况等评估承兑方的信用状况并设置内部信用评级。本集团会定期对承兑方信用
记录进行监控，对于信用记录不良的承兑方，本集团会采用书面催款等方式，以确保本集团的整体信用
风险在可控的范围内。对于应收财务公司承兑汇票和商业承兑汇票，本集团根据违约风险敞口按整个存
续期内的预期信用损失率，计算预期信用损失，相关预期信用损失计量详见(附注(五)、3)。 
 
对于其他应收款，本集团会定期对债务人信用记录进行监控，对于信用记录不良的债务人，本集团会采
用书面催款等方式，以确保本集团的整体信用风险在可控的范围内。对于其他应收款，本集团根据违约
风险敞口按未来12 个月或整个存续期内的预期信用损失率，计算预期信用损失，相关预期信用损失计量
详见(附注(五)、8)。 
 
本集团的风险敞口分布在多个合同方和多个客户，因此本集团无重大信用集中风险。 
 
1.3 
流动风险 
 
管理流动风险时，本集团保持管理层认为充分的现金及现金等价物并对其进行监控，以满足本集团经营
需要，并降低现金流量波动的影响。本集团管理层对银行借款的使用情况进行监控并确保遵守借款协议。

限制性股票激励计划 
 
经国务院国有资产监督管理委员会《关于杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司实施限制性股票激励计划
的批复》(国资分配[2012]426 号)和中国证券监督管理委员会《关于杭州海康威视数字技术股份有限公司
限制性股票激励计划的意见》(上市部函[2012]353 号)的批准，公司于2012 年7 月25 日第二届董事会九
次会议，及2012 年8 月13 日2012 年第一次临时股东大会审议通过了《关于公司〈限制性股票计划(草
案修订稿)〉及摘要的议案》。该股权激励计划的目的是：进一步完善公司治理结构，形成良好、均衡的
价值分配体系；建立股东、公司与员工之间的利益共享与约束机制，为股东带来持续回报；充分调动核
心员工的积极性，支持公司战略实现和长期可持续发展；吸引和保留核心员工，确保公司长期发展。 
 
本计划的有效期为10 年，自股东大会批准之日起生效。在计划有效期内，公司可以依据本计划向激励对
象授予限制性股票。原则上每次授予之间需间隔两年。计划有效期满后，公司不得依据本计划向激励对
象授予任何限制性股票；但本计划的各项条款对依据本计划授出的限制性股票依然有效。 
 
公司和激励对象每次需同时满足公司解锁业绩条件(包括净资产收益率、营业收入增长率和经济增加值)
和个人业绩条件，每批次限制性股票方可解锁。当解锁期内有一个或一个以上公司或个人解锁条件未达
成的，该部分标的股票作废。作废的限制性股票将由公司根据本计划的相关规定进行回购。 
 
公司于2018 年12 月20 日，根据2018 年第二次临时股东大会授权，经董事会审议通过，向激励对象授
予限制性股票121,195,458 股，限制性股票授予价格为16.98 元/股(“2018 股权激励”)。在授予日后的24
个月为标的股票锁定期，激励对象根据本计划持有的标的股票将被锁定且不得以任何形式转让；限制性
股票授予后(包括锁定期内)的24 个月至60 个月为解锁期，在解锁期内，若达到本股权激励计划规定的
解锁条件，授予的限制性股票分三次解锁：第一次解锁期为授予日24 个月后至36 个月内，解锁数量是
当次获授标的股票总数的40%；第二次解锁期为授予日36 个月后至48 个月内，解锁数量是当次获授标
的股票总数的30%；第三次解锁期为授予日48 个月后至60 个月内，解锁数量是当次获授标的股票总数
的30%。公司于2019 年1 月完成股权登记工作。

   员工跟投创新业务股权激励计划 
 
公司于2015 年10 月22 日第二次临时股东大会审议通过《核心员工跟投创新业务管理办法(草案)》(以下
简称“管理办法”)，于2016 年3 月7 日，海康威视工会代表大会通过了《核心员工跟投创新业务管理办
法实施细则》(以下简称“细则”)，对创新业务子公司启动实施员工跟投的激励机制(以下简称“员工跟投计
划”)。参与员工跟投计划的员工(以下简称“跟投员工”)与海康威视工会委员会(以下简称“海康威视工会”)
签署《委托投资协议》，委托海康威视工会进行投资，海康威视工会作为委托人与信托公司合作，设立
信托计划，由信托公司作为合伙企业的有限合伙人，将信托资金投资于创新业务子公司。(上述跟投形式
简称“跟投平台”)。 
 
员工跟投计划根据适用对象不同分为A 计划和B 计划。A 计划的对象系由公司及其下属分子公司的中高
层管理人员和核心骨干员工组成，跟投所有创新业务。B 计划的对象系由创新业务及其下属分子公司核
心员工且是全职员工组成，参与跟投其所在的创新业务子公司。跟投平台每年进行增资，增资部分对应
的平台权益根据特定规则分配给符合跟投条件的核心员工。员工自持有跟投平台权益后的5 年为等待期。
在等待期内激励对象与公司或子公司的劳动关系解除或终止，则持有的跟投平台份额将由工会根据细则
约定的价格退还份额清算价款。 
 
跟投平台每年新增份额授予跟投员工，本集团于每个授予日根据本集团员工新获得的跟投平台权益工具
的公允价值判断是否构成股份支付。 
 
2020 年12 月，跟投员工与海康威视工会签订了《委托投资协议》之《补充协议》(以下简称“《补充协
议》”)。公司于2020 年12 月25 日召开第四届董事会第二十次会议，审议通过了《关于修订<核心员工
跟投创新业务管理办法>的议案》。新版《核心员工跟投创新业务管理办法》(以下简称“新版《管理办法》”)
增加了对员工持有跟投计划份额和间接持有创新业务子公司的权益进行确权，明确了员工丧失或被取消
跟投资格后跟投份额的处理方法、增加管理委员会等制度。 
 
于2020 年12 月31 日，跟投方案执行管理委员会通过了《核心员工跟投创新业务管理办法实施细则》
(以下简称“新版细则”)。根据新版《管理办法》和新版细则，对于已确权的A 计划份额，等待期为该员
工于公司或其分子公司工作满五周年；对于已确权的B 计划份额，等待期为该员工于该B 计划对应的创
新业务子公司或其下属分子公司工作满五周年。

作为本公司信用风险管理的一部分，本公司按照业务的区域和对象的风险特征将应收账款划分为组合A、组合B 和组合C，并基于应收账款超信用期账龄采用减
值矩阵确定每个组合的预期信用损失。对于集团内子公司产生的应收账款，由于付款时间由集团根据集团内各公司的现金流情况予以安排，本公司认为信用风险
低，无须计提坏账准备。账龄信息能反映这三类客户于应收账款到期时的偿付能力。
